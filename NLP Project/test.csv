If it is licensed with what or with whom does the license go with?For example, I have a car with FSD. When I sell the car, can I take the FSD and put it on my new Tesla and let the new owner buy his own FSD license? Or does it stay with the car, if once on the car it is always with the car? Or does it stay with the car as long as the original buyer is the owner? (If I sell my computer with say MS Word on it, I can either take the Word license and put it on my new computer or the new owner has the license and I have to buy a new one, both cannot use it. How does Tesla FSD operate: is it a add on and not a part of the car in that sense)Second would be upgrades. Even if you have FSD on car you bought used, are you eligible for all the upgrades if you were not the original buyer of the FSD?Unfortunately Tesla, seems to indicate that it is a part of the car (https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/fsd-transferable) but not anything beyond that. My guess is when you upgrade the software in a Tesla, it is going to be difficult to take the software out. What Tesla has (my guess) is a kill switch, that they can deactivate the usage of that function in that car. So they may insist it stays on the car, rather then with the buyer.It appears from the video that Tesla is cracking down on people who cannot prove they bought FSD. If you buy a used Tesla, make sure they have paid for the FSD and get you the proof. If you buy from a dealer, you may be out of luck if Tesla comes after you. One reason to buy directly from Tesla.This is still a grey area and only Tesla can tell you what the situation is."

1,"copenhagen (reuters) - the world‚Äôs largest wind turbine maker vestas ( vws.co ) is tapping into experience from the car battery industry to try to address the challenge of using erratic wind and solar energy to meet a growing share of power demand. file photo: maintenance work is done on a vestas wind turbine (r) at a wind energy park near heide, germany, september 9, 2010. reuters/christian charisius energy storage is becoming increasingly important as production of renewable energy rises, because the wind might not blow or the sun shine during the peak hours when most consumers turns on their lights and appliances. in order to bring down cost of renewable energy and help grid operators balance intermittent output, vestas last year said it would work to combine wind, solar and battery storage technology. as part of this, it invested 10 million euros ($12 million) in battery manufacturer northvolt, which aims to build europe‚Äôs biggest battery cell plant with the backing of investors such as volkswagen-owned ( vowg_p.de ) truckmaker scania. ‚Äúwe can piggyback on all the research they do with batteries for cars and get an excellent industry battery at the same time,‚Äù vestas chairman bert nordberg told reuters. vestas is partnering with sweden‚Äôs northvolt, headed by former tesla executive peter carlsson, to develop a lithium-ion battery for power plants of the future. battery costs have traditionally been high, but the technology is becoming increasingly viable as automakers such as bmw ( bmwg.de ), daimler ( daign.de ), volkswagen and volvo car group ( 0175.hk ) ramp up electric car production. nordberg said the investment into northvolt meant vestas could demand development and research into the kind of battery storage it is interested in, and would also be able to place people there. vestas is also working with bigger players such as u.s. electric carmaker tesla ( tsla.o ), whose batteries it plans to use in the world‚Äôs first utility-scale project for this technology to store power from both wind and solar sources. ‚Äúthe output from solar and wind is very intermittent and we need to even that out,‚Äù nordberg said. nordberg is part of a swedish trio, which also includes ceo anders runevad and finance chief marika frederiksson, that has turned vestas around and, helped by cost cutting, lifted the company‚Äôs operating margin to industry leading levels. vestas will continue to make acquisitions within storage and hybrid energy solutions, he said, but declined to say how much it might spend or which targets it was considering. ‚Äúthe idea is that we should be a technology company, we are not trying to move into buying and selling wind parks,‚Äù he said. reporting by stine jacobsen; editing by mark potter"

1,"2 comments london‚Äîglobal demand for crude oil could peak in the next two decades, as renewables like solar power surge faster than expected to meet a greater share of the world‚Äôs energy needs, bp bp 0.83% plc said tuesday. the world‚Äôs appetite for oil and other liquid fuels could continue to grow until around 2035, hitting 110.3 million barrels a day‚Äîcompared with 95 million barrels a day in 2015‚Äîbefore plateauing and falling off in the run up to 2040, the british oil-and-gas giant said tuesday in the main future scenario, releasing its annual energy outlook. peak demand could represent a potential reckoning for energy companies that had grown accustomed to crude consumption growing almost every year for over a century. already, bp, royal dutch shell plc and other companies have been investing more in natural gas, which has become a vital fuel for producing electricity, and experimenting with renewable production. bp‚Äôs outlook shows peak-oil demand coming more quickly than it has forecast in the past. until now, the company has said crude demand wouldn‚Äôt stop growing until the 2040s. unlike competitors, bp releases annual forecasts making predictions about a range of issues including industry investment, supply and demand. shell has said peak demand could come as soon as 2025 while chevron corp. and exxon mobil corp. don‚Äôt foresee a peak. bp‚Äôs central forecast assumes that current government policies, technology and societal preferences will evolve in the future similarly to how they have in recent years. big recent changes have included countries like the u.k. and france planning severe restrictions on the combustion engine and a major push for electric vehicles in china. bp stressed the central forecast was one of six possible scenarios, none of which it would endorse as most likely. all the scenarios show oil demand eventually peaking before 2040 and then declining . in this scenario, renewable sources of energy would increase five-fold to provide around 14% of primary energy globally, contributing to the most diversified energy mix ever. ‚Äúby 2040, oil, gas, coal and non-fossil fuels each account for around a quarter of the world‚Äôs energy. more than 40% of the overall increase in energy demand is met by renewable energy,‚Äù said spencer dale, bp‚Äôs group chief economist. oil consumption should grow by an average of 0.14% per year between 2016 and 2040, according to the bp scenario, compared with predictions of 0.19%, 0.12% and 0.17% annual oil growth consumption by, respectively, the u.s. energy information administration, the international energy agency and the organization of the petroleum exporting countries. still, bp expects personal vehicles and industrial trucks ‚Äúto be dominated by oil,‚Äù with demand for the fuel comprising around 85% of total transport fuel demand in 2040, compared with 94% today. the majority of that demand should come from developing economies like china and india, bp said. related opec says oil demand will grow past 2040 at the same time, bp‚Äôs evolving transition scenario predicts the number of electric cars on the road will rise to roughly 320 million by 2040, accounting for about 30% of passenger vehicle kilometers. that increase should be bolstered by the emergence of fully-autonomous vehicles in the next decade, most of which are expected to be electrically powered. bp‚Äôs views on peak-oil demand aren‚Äôt universally accepted in the industry. last month at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, saudi energy minister khalid al-falih said oil demand would rise as high as 120 million barrels a day over the next two to three decades. write to christopher alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com"

""about 1 minute and 22 seconds before the crash, she re-enabled autosteer and cruise control, and then, within seconds, took her hands off the steering wheel again,"" the police report says. ""she did not touch the steering wheel for the next 80 seconds until the crash happened."" the car was programmed by the driver to travel at 60 mph. the driver finally touched the brake pedal ""a second prior to the crash."" police said the driver not only failed to abide by the guidelines of autopilot use but also engaged the system on a street with no center median and with stop lights. some automakers, such as cadillac, have driver assist systems that only function if maps indicate that the vehicle is traveling on a route, typically a highway, that is compatible with a car taking over some driving duties. the utah driver was issued a traffic citation for ""failure to keep proper lookout"" under south jordan city municipal code. both nhtsa and the national transportation safety board assisted local police in the investigation. the two federal agencies both are looking into a tesla model s crash in florida that killed two teenagers. the agencies are looking into the fire that resulted from the electric car's batteries igniting. the two agencies also continue to investigate a march crash of a tesla model x in mountain view, calif. the vehicle was in autopilot mode when it slammed into a concrete barrier that divided a busy silicon valley highway. tesla said that the driver in the mountain view crash did not heed repeated warnings from the car to resume control of the vehicle. the driver's family has retain legal counsel and is contemplating a lawsuit based on previous complaints made by the driver about the autopilot system's inability to navigate that specific piece of highway. the electric car company is in the middle of a huge push to ramp up production of its critical model 3 sedan, an entry-level vehicle that it hopes will turbocharge electric car sales among a new demographic and fill the companies coffers after years of bleeding cash."

0,"243 comments Ôªø tsla -6.20% tesla tsla -6.20% inc. burned through cash at a greater rate than analysts expected during the first quarter, intensifying pressure on the silicon valley auto maker to raise more capital if it continues to struggle ramping up production of the model 3 sedan. the company‚Äôs free cash flow widened to about a negative $1 billion after burning $277 million in the final three months of last year, a figure that was unusually low thanks, in part, to delays in spending and customer deposits. despite the increased spending, chief executive elon musk indicated the company won‚Äôt need to raise more money because it is still on pace to make about 5,000 model 3s in a single week by around the end of the second quarter. the twice postponed goal is critical, analysts say, for tesla to generate cash and reach profitability. the increased rate of production, coupled with plans to reduce capital expenditures, should help tesla become cash-flow positive in the second half of the year and profitable in the third and fourth quarters, the company said. that would be a big reversal from the first quarter, when tesla posted a loss attributable to common shareholders of $710 million, its fifth consecutive quarter of record losses. tesla‚Äôs per-share loss of $3.35 was narrower than analysts‚Äô average expectations, according to factset, but those projections were lowered significantly in recent months. during a combative conference call with analysts on wednesday, mr. musk answered curtly when adam jonas of morgan stanley asked whether it would be prudent for tesla to raise more capital while it can even if it doesn‚Äôt need it. ‚Äúno,‚Äù mr. musk replied. ‚Äúi specifically don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù later on the call, mr. musk cut off two analysts who were asking about tesla‚Äôs business‚Äîspecifically capital expenditures and model 3 reservations‚Äîcalling the questions ‚Äúso dry. they‚Äôre killing me.‚Äù related heard on the street: tesla can‚Äôt make its cash problems disappear as mr. musk deflected some questions, the stock started sliding in after-hours trading, falling as much as 6% in about a 20-minute period, before settling down 4.6% at 8 p.m. edt. tesla‚Äôs stock had fallen more than 3% in 2018. production of the model 3 sedan, which began in july, has bedeviled mr. musk at the company‚Äôs fremont, calif., factory, where in recent weeks he has conceded to relying too much on automation to make the vehicle that was supposed to start at $35,000 but instead goes for $49,000 in the u.s. the lower-priced version, with a shorter battery range, isn‚Äôt expected to reach the market until later this year. the model 3 is part of mr. musk‚Äôs vision of bringing electric cars to the masses and turning tesla into something more than a luxury car company selling model s sedans and model x sport-utility vehicles that average for $100,000. his gamble of remaking the automotive landscape, however, is facing a critical make-or-break period as the company struggles with the model 3. the company has little wiggle room and needs to begin generating cash or else raise more money. last month, tesla said it won‚Äôt need to raise any debt or equity this year, apart from standard credit lines. tesla on wednesday said it expects to cut back on spending and generate positive cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, ‚Äúincluding the inflow of cash that we receive in the normal course of our business from financing activities on leased vehicle and solar products.‚Äù analysts surveyed by factset on average predicted a negative free cash flow of $889 million during the first quarter. the company averaged a negative free cash burn of $900 million a quarter last year. these totals don‚Äôt include payments for solar energy systems. tesla finished the first quarter with $2.7 billion in cash on hand, compared with $3.4 billion at the end of last year. customer deposits, for vehicles such as the model 3 and roadster, rose about 15% to $985 million from the end of last year. the cash levels put tesla ‚Äúin good shape providing they do start generating cash later this year,‚Äù said david whiston, an analyst for morningstar research services llc. tesla said it was cutting back on capital expenditures this year to ‚Äúslightly‚Äù less than $3 billion from $3.4 billion last year. ‚Äúwe have significantly cut back our capex projections by focusing on the critical near-term needs that benefit us primarily in the next couple of years,‚Äù mr. musk wrote in a letter to shareholders on wednesday. tesla‚Äôs total vehicle deliveries, announced last month, rose 20% to 29,997, including 8,812 model 3 vehicles. deliveries of the higher-priced model s sedan and model x sport-utility vehicle, however, fell about 13% combined compared with a year ago. revenue rose about 26% to $3.41 billion, beating analyst expectations of $3.28 billion. tesla made 9,766 model 3s during the first quarter and fell short of its goal of making 2,500 in a single week. in april, it said that it reached a rate of 2,000 in a seven-day period that included two days of the second quarter. mr. musk had once suggested the company could make as many as 200,000 model 3s in the second half of last year. while he had warned in july that the model 3 ramp-up would be hard, mr. musk has said it has been worse than expected. he has retaken control of production and said earlier this year that he was sleeping sometimes at the factory. he has directed the factory to work 24 hours, seven days a week and aims to make as many 4,000 model 3s in a single week this month followed by some additional upgrades to the factory so they can make as many 6,000 a week by the end of june. he set the goal of making 5,000 a week by the end of the second quarter, a milestone that has twice been delayed. mr. musk recently told ‚Äúcbs this morning‚Äù that he finally sees a way through the challenges.

I wonder what will be solution for densely populated areas where this will not be possible.I couldn't agree with you more.Clearly, however, the right solution for shared infrastructure is to go all the way with DC Fast Charging, allowing you to charge in a matter of minutes instead of hours.Level 2 charging is generally intended to be cheap enough that you can tie up a charger for a long period of time. There's a complex balance that car manufacturers must make between how much money to spend for an onboard charger for every car or whether that money should be pooled together for a more expensive shared off-board charger that many can use.You may recall that Nissan blew it by initially offering only a 3.3 kW onboard charger for the Leaf. That, while workable, was clearly too slow for many and they eventually increased it to 6.6 kW. Tesla shot high with their initial 20 kW onboard chargers and then observed how seldom the full capacity was ever used so they reduced it.There are some companies that are offering DC Chargers at lower power levels that aren't fast enough to require expensive electrical infrastructure, yet are faster than many want to spend on powerful onboard chargers. https://www.dcbel.energy is one example that I know of.I suspect that, as EV driving demographics change, there may be further changes.

Unfortunately, I don't think Tesla can afford to do this. I wonder whether replacing machines with people is a long-term solution too.Conventional car companies have learned the hard way to set up a pilot plant first, in order to refine the production methods. Musk, who strikes me as something of a smartass, seems to have thought that he can skip this stage.Also, modern cars are extremely complex, and in order to maintain them the manufacturer has to keep meticulous records of the build state of every individual model accommodating changes in supplier or variations as less costly components are found and incorporated. This is very easy to do with a fully automated properly designed production line, but a lot more difficult if the like is in a state of constant flux with machines being replaced with people and presumably vice versa.

""i think it's going to happen more quickly than decades,"" barra told cnbc in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. ""as more and more people recognize that we have the right range, understand that we have a charging infrastructure so they don't think you're going to be stranded, i think you're going to see ev adoption continue,"" the gm ceo said. gm will increase production of the chevrolet bolt later this year at its orion assembly plant near detroit to meet growing demand around the world for the all-electric model, barra announced on wednesday. patrick t. fallon | bloomberg | getty images general motors ceo mary barra unveiled the chevrolet bolt electric vehicle during the 2016 consumer electronics show in las vegas. barra said the scale of the production increase was yet to be determined, but the ramp-up would create new jobs at the plant. in a speech, barra called on the energy industry and other stakeholders to partner with gm to expand the u.s. network of charging stations. she said the infrastructure would boost customers' confidence that they can use their electric vehicles anywhere and anytime.

( nsany ) is taking its first steps to becoming an operator of autonomous vehicle services, hoping to break into a segment set to be dominated by uber and other technology firms.  while automakers for more than a century have based their business models on individual car ownership, japan's no.2 automaker and its rivals are now preparing for a future in which self-driving cars are anticipated to curb vehicle ownership.  in partnership with japanese mobile gaming platform operator dena co. ( dnacf ), nissan will begin public field tests of its easy ride service in yokohama next month, becoming among the first major automakers anywhere to test ride-hailing software developed in-house, using its own fleet of self-driving electric cars.  easy ride, which nissan plans to launch in japan in the early 2020s, is meant to feel more like a concierge service on wheels, making ‚Äî for example ‚Äî restaurant recommendations while the car is on the move. read relevant legal disclosures  the announcement follows an agreement by nissan and its automaking partners renault sa ( rnlsy ) and mitsubishi motors corp. ( mmtoy ) earlier this month to explore future cooperation with chinese transportation services conglomerate didi chuxing.  these moves mark a push by the automaker to avoid becoming the ""foxconn of the auto industry:"" a mere vehicle supplier to ride- and car-sharing companies.  ""we realize that it's going to take time to become a service operator, but we want to enter into this segment by partnering with companies which are experts in the field,"" nissan's chief executive, hiroto saikawa, told reuters in an interview this month. a person close to the deal has said that the agreement is intended to explore opportunities for nissan and others to supply battery-electric cars to didi chuxing for a new electric car-sharing service it is setting up in china.  he noted, however, that nissan and its alliance partners could explore a broader agreement, which might possibly involve nissan providing self-driving taxi technology to the dominant chinese ride-hailing service.

Certainly it's reasonable to argue that a lot of people are going to seriously question buying a car which doesn't even have such basic functions as FM radio! Maybe we're just having a pointless argument over labels. I'd call a car model where the FM radio is present, but not enabled, ""unfinished"" rather than ""not real"". The latter seems misleading to me, and seems to tie in with the Tesla haters' attempts to falsely portray deliveries of early production Model 3's as being ""fake"" sales.Personally I'm not convinced that the early production TM3s didn't have functional FM radio, despite one report that one delivered car didn't have it.

1,"Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-12/how-tesla-s-model-3-became-elon-musk-s-version-of-hellIn early 2015, Musk convened a meeting of his top engineers in a windowless conference room at the factory. There were 12 people, including experts in batteries, design, chassis, interiors, body, drive systems, safety, and thermodynamics. Musk, who did not attend himself, had gathered them to figure out what the Model 3 would be.Over the course of the meeting, the engineers filled a whiteboard with dozens of requirements, including a range of at least 200 miles and an affordable price. The last of these criteria made the project especially daunting. Even scarier, Tesla would begin selling it in mid-2017, giving the company 2‚Äâ¬Ω years to design, test, and build a new vehicle, compared with about five years at a traditional automaker.Creating a low-cost electric car is about maximizing range in every possible way. For instance, Tesla‚Äôs designers added plastic covers, costing $1.50 each, to hide four pads on the underside of the car where a jack goes. The decision reduced wind resistance and improved the car‚Äôs range by 3 miles. They also opted for four-piston monoblock caliper brakes, which are usually reserved for more expensive cars. But since the brakes are lightweight, they lower the car‚Äôs battery requirements and overall cost. ‚ÄúEvery single decision like that was put back into the context of an electric car,‚Äù says Doug Field, a former Apple vice president Musk recruited as a top engineer in 2013. In other words, electric cars require new ways of thinking about cost and performance.This is why an 'established' car manufacturer faces a cultural change challenge. Because of the Prius, Toyota has a culture of efficient designs. But other car makers, not even close.Bob Wilson"

However, given Tesla's ongoing policy of putting hardware features into its cars without the software being enabled until months after the car is delivered, it seems that no Tesla car is ever going to be ""real"" by your definition. What you are calling ""not real"" is what Tesla would call ""leaning forward"".Most buyers of Tesla cars, or at least the ones posting comments to the Tesla Motors Club forum, see Tesla's policy of forward enabling as an advantage, as a series of ""presents"" over the months after they take delivery of their car, as Tesla enables one function after another. They don't see it from the negative viewpoint you're expressing, as ""relevant"" features not being enabled when the car is delivered.I think Tesla has the right policy. The alternative would be for Tesla to not put ""forward leaning"" hardware into its newest cars; to wait until software was fully developed before putting the hardware which that software needs into production cars. That means there would be a lot of Tesla owners disappointed that they missed out on a new feature which they would have gotten if they had waited a few weeks, or maybe a month or two.That would lead to would-be Tesla buyers delaying a purchase in the hopes that they would get more features by waiting a few weeks or months. Clearly that would not benefit Tesla's income, nor would it be of any benefit to Tesla car owners.In summary, I think it's safe to say there could never be any consensus around your opinion, Counterpoint.

""we need to collectively help tell the story of the benefits of this technology and raise awareness."" automakers are rapidly investing in evs and say they plan to unveil dozens of new evs in the coming years. they point to the growing range of evs to travel on a single charge, lower battery costs and more recharging stations as all making the vehicles more attractive to customers. joe eberhardt, president and chief executive officer of jaguar land rover north america, said in an interview at the auto show that companies must focus on consumer demand not regulatory mandates. ""we need as an industry to find a way to convince customers that there is a real benefit and advantage to having an electric vehicle,"" he said. in january, ford motor co said it would double its electrified vehicle spending. reuters reported that global automakers plan to invest $90 billion in batteries and electric cars in the coming years, an amount that is still growing. investments in electrified vehicles announced to date include at least $19 billion by automakers in the united states, $21 billion in china and $52 billion in germany. automakers also are reacting to pressure from regulators in europe and california to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels and mandates from california to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles.""

0,"Roy_correctly identifies the production gaps as the reason the graphs got out of whack, but did not adjust correctly. My theory is that these number gaps are AWD versions and Tesla grossly underestimated demand for the AWD version. They simply did not have enough front wheel drive motors to fulfill the demand, so they skipped these and built more RWD versions. Bloomberg's tracker assumes that these skipped VINs were built and falsely stated production exceeded 6000, but instead of going back and correcting the earlier production figures, he is now compensating with low current production values to bring the average back in line. I believe Tesla has now scaled up the front motor drive production and is filling this gap in VINs now as fast as they can. Tesla has registered 59866 Model 3 VINs since July 1 and I believe the gap is being filled now so I expect most of these to be built by the end of the month. My prediction is that we will see 60k+ for the quarter.Click to expand...You are mostly correct. But the Bloomberg new tracker will count the AWD models as it finds sample data in those gaps. The tracker decreased cumulative count by 4.4% , as stated in the last update comment. When they are counted, it will recoup this decrease.It also corrected the past data points, as seen in the line plot now. This plot reflects the new more accurate (presumed) model.Regarding Tesla's intent to fudge/fool the data: Look no further than their past history of randomizing VIN assignments etc."

0,"pinterest while automakers are fixated on developing the next generation of electric cars, one british firm has other ideas. riversimple is hoping that its hydrogen-powered two-seater car, which has a futuristic design crossed with retro traits, might be able to offer a viable alternative to electric vehicles. the wales-based company has created a car called rasa. it says it runs on 1.5 kilograms of hydrogen and can go 300 miles. the vehicle‚Äôs engineering is very different to other cars on the market. for example, it has a motor on each wheel. it is powered by reverse electrolysis. hydrogen and oxygen are combined to create electricity and water is a by-product that drips out of the exhaust. ‚Äúall the major auto manufacturers are building hydrogen cars but they are trying to retrofit the technology into the sort of cars they make. and they‚Äôre all, effectively, built the same way as cars have ‚Ä¶ been for the last hundred years. the petrol engine taken out and a fuel cell put in place. we‚Äôve started from a clean sheet of paper,‚Äù hugo spowers, founder of riversimple, told cnbc in an interview aired friday. riversimple‚Äôs car is taking on other hydrogen models like the toyota mirai, but also electric vehicles from the likes of tesla and other major automakers. it is hoping its business model might help it differentiate. riversimple won‚Äôt let anyone own one of its cars. instead will allow people to pay monthly to drive the car. and that fee also includes a refill of hydrogen as well as insurance. ‚Äúit‚Äôs more like a mobile phone. it‚Äôs a single direct debit that covers all the running costs. it includes insurance and it even includes fuel ‚Ä¶ but it completely changes the sort of car that we build, because it‚Äôs an asset on our balance sheet, and the longer we can keep it generating revenue the better, the more efficient it is the better ‚Ä¶ and the lower maintenances the better,‚Äù spowers said. a rasa can travel 300 miles on full fuel versus 335 miles for a tesla model s on a single charge. but spowers claims that the energy efficiency is better on a hydrogen car. ‚Äúenergy efficiency is probably the single metric we have really got to chase in the future. batteries are very heavy and the efficiency of a car depends on the weight of the car hugely. so batteries are really good for short-range applications. but at about 100, or 120 miles, we believe we can make a more efficient hydrogen car than a battery car. and if you‚Äôre talking a 300 mile range, 400 mile ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs chalk and cheese, it‚Äôs so much more efficient,‚Äù spowers told cnbc. riversimple is currently producing a handful of cars with the aim of having mass production by 2020. interestingly, spowers said the company will open source its technology designs meaning other carmakers could theoretically copy them. the riversimple founder says this is not an issue because the market is big enough. ‚Äúwhat we want is those standards to become ubiquitous. we are using different fuel cells ‚Ä¶ we want people to copy us because effectively, we are building different cars to the industry and we want to build volumes in (the) supply chain to reduce our costs,‚Äù spowers told cnbc."

As with every pull-out-the-stops week ending a quarter, Tesla ramped up to an unsustainable production pace, and then immediately after had to take a few days of slack production -- or even a few days off -- for everyone to rest and recuperate.Personally I wish Tesla would quit this binge-and-purge cycle.

0,"frankfurt (reuters) - german auto supplier robert bosch [robg.ul] announced on wednesday a new code of conduct for staff and improved exhaust control technology, as it strives to draw a line under an emissions scandal that has tarnished the diesel car industry. prosecutors in stuttgart are probing several car brands and supplier bosch for their suspected roles in using an engine control unit, edc17, to cheat exhaust emissions tests. volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) used the unit in its ea189 diesel engine, which was found in 2015 to artificially throttle back real-world pollution levels during a regulatory test cycle, triggering a global crackdown on carmakers and toxic pollution. earlier this month, prosecutors seized an unknown number of files at volkswagen‚Äôs sportscar brands porsche and audi. chief financial officer stefan asenkerschbaumer said on wednesday bosch had set aside 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to cover potential risks stemming from antitrust probes and an investigation into diesel emissions cheating. that is up slightly from the 1.1 billion euros announced last year. the stuttgart-based auto supplier also said it would teach 70,000 staff a new code of conduct for developers by the end of this year in an effort to change the ‚Äúmindset‚Äù of the company. as part of the new rules, it will be forbidden to permit the installation of functions that automatically help a vehicle recognize when it is being subjected to an emissions test, and bosch products are not allowed to be tweaked to help a manufacturer pass a test, the company said. ‚Äúwe view the principles as a way to guide and motivate our engineers,‚Äù bosch said. using software, some volkswagen cars could detect when they were being subjected to an emissions test and increase the effectiveness of exhaust filtering systems to temporarily keep emissions within legal limits. bosch has said manufacturers, not suppliers, are legally responsible for ensuring vehicles obtain road certification by legal means. it has said it takes allegations of engine manipulation ‚Äúvery seriously‚Äù and is fully cooperating with authorities. bosch also said on wednesday it had developed a new exhaust emissions treatment technology that cuts pollution from health-threatening nitrogen oxides (nox) to 13 milligrams per kilometre, well below the current legal limit of 120 milligrams. the new system costs roughly the same as a sophisticated exhaust filter system included in high-end diesel vehicles, bosch said. ‚Äúthis breakthrough offers the opportunity to shift the heated debate over diesel into new territory and, hopefully, bring it to a close.‚Äù electric cars will not become a mass market phenomenon until at least 2020, bosch said. ‚Äúuntil electromobility breaks through to the mass market, we will still need these highly efficient combustion engines,‚Äù bosch chief executive volkmar denner said.

""we're really more looking at the fire aspects,"" ntsb chairman robert sumwalt told reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck. tesla declined to comment on the august incident. the ntsb previously said it also is probing an incident in which a tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in california in january. the law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system. ""(our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,"" minami said. while sympathizing with the family, tesla again blamed huang, saying he was well aware that autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged autopilot. tesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned huang several times on the day of the crash to do so. ""the crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if mr. huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,"" a tesla spokesperson told reuters.

""in the specialty plant nutrient business line, sales volumes increased 15% in 2017 due to strong demand growth and decreased supply from our competition. our operations team has achieved new operational improvements by significantly integrating the production process at the coya sur facilities, while improving the use of raw materials, allowing an increase of nitrates production capacity up to 1.3 million mt/year. the improvements were made with minimum investments. as a result of this changes, we were able to increase our sales volumes while providing necessary supply to the potassium nitrate market."" ""in the iodine and derivatives business line, we were able to achieve our target, set few years ago, to regain our market share. in 2017, we successfully increased our market share to over 35%, reporting historically high sales volumes of 12.7k mt. prices have shown a slight recovery during the year and, considering today's pricing environment, prices are expected to be higher in 2018."" he continued by saying, ""we achieved the same sales volumes in our lithium and derivatives business line in 2017 as in the previous year, while the prices increased 25% with an average price reaching over us$13,500 per metric ton in the fourth quarter. on these days, we continue to see a tight market, mainly driven by a strong demand that is still growing over 15% per year, more than offsetting the new supply that came into the market during the second half of last year. for the remainder of this year, we expect that the strong demand growth will continue, while at the same time, new projects are expected to increase their output during the second half of the year."" lithium projects in january 2018, the company announced that it reached an agreement with corfo to finish the arbitration processes that started in may 2014. the agreement included a one-time payment of approximately us$20 million that is reflected in the fourth quarter 2017 results. as part of the agreement, sqm is allowed to produce and sell up to 2.2 million mt of lithium carbonate equivalent (lce) through 2030, albeit at higher lease payments to corfo and other associated cost. the new payment structure will become effective, as of the moment the agreement is approved by regulatory authorities in chile, which we expect to occur during march 2018. patricio de solminihac commented, ""we are pleased that we have reached an agreement with corfo that will let us continue developing a successful story in the salar de atacama. the new production allowance granted in the agreement gives us flexibility to increase our operation capacity as the market continues growing, allowing us to keep a market share around 25% during the next few years."" then he continued saying, ""approximately a year ago, we announced a capacity expansion from 48,000 to 63,000 mt of lithium carbonate in chile, to be finished in 2018. this expansion project is being revised to reach a total production capacity of 70,000 mt this year. on top of this, we are working on a project to increase our plant capacity by another 30,000 mt in 2019, reaching 100,000 mt of total capacity in chile. the total budget for both stages will be approximately us$170 million. we will evaluate the timing for future expansions in the salar de atacama based on market conditions."" patricio de solminihac closed by saying, ""we truly believe in the lithium market as the demand growth, mainly driven by the development of the electric vehicles (evs), should remain very strong in the coming years. the market will need more efficient projects to come on line to maintain the market equilibrium and support the development of the evs and battery industries. being one of the largest lithium producers in the world, we feel the responsibility to grow together with our customers and the market. along with new expansions in chile, we will continue development of our projects abroad. in argentina, we expect the first stage of the minera exar project of 25,000 mt/year to be ready by 2020, the construction of the evaporations ponds has begun, and the filling of the evaporation ponds will begin in the second half of the year. in the meantime, we continue working on the detailed engineering of the chemical plant. in australia, we completed the purchase of the mt. holland project in december 2017 and are working on further exploration of the resource, development of the feasibility study and required environmental permits, all of this with the goal of starting production in 2021."" for the complete version of this press release, please visit our ir web site: http://ir.sqm.com/english/investor-relation/default.aspx about sqm sqm is an integrated producer and distributor of lithium, iodine, specialty plant nutrients, potassium-related fertilizers and industrial chemicals. its products are based on the development of high quality natural resources that allow the company to be a leader in costs, supported by a specialized international network with sales in over 110 countries. sqm's business strategy is to be a mining operator that selectively integrates the production and sales of products to industries essential for human development, such as food, health and technology. the strategy is built on the following six principles: strengthen internal processes to ensure access to key resources required for the sustainability of the business;

1,"berlin/hamburg (reuters) - germany‚Äôs continental ( cong.de ) is in talks with banks about a possible structural overhaul of the auto parts and tire maker and aims to flesh out its plans within six months, its finance chief said. the hanover-based group said on tuesday it was in ‚Äúearly stages‚Äù of talks about possible structural changes to become more nimble as auto manufacturers are spending billions of euros on electric and self-driving technologies, confirming media reports earlier in the day. ‚Äúwe are looking at the organization of continental in its entirety,‚Äù finance chief wolfgang schaefer said in an interview late on tuesday after the group released core 2017 earnings. growing demand for electrification and driver-assistance technologies drove continental‚Äôs sales about 8 percent higher last year to around 44 billion euros, and the company expects a further increase to around 47 billion this year. but its adjusted operating margin may ease to around 10.5 percent this year amid spending on new tire-making facilities, after the profitability benchmark rose to a higher-than-expected 10.8 percent last year, it said. with the auto industry wrapped up in a strategic transition to zero-emission cars and self-driving technology, carmakers and suppliers are repositioning their businesses and spinning off operations to focus more effectively on new technologies. daimler ( daign.de ) has said it may split parts of its business into separate legal entities, which may allow for a partial listing to raise funds to invest in new services such as autonomous and electric cars. parts makers such as delphi ( dlph.n ) and autoliv ( alv.n ) have spun off divisions to simplify their corporate structures and react to the changes in technology, moves cheered by investors who believe internal combustion engine cars are a sunset industry. combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in europe and china, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. that risk was exacerbated by vw‚Äôs diesel emissions scandal. continental has said software and electronics products are the biggest drivers of growth at the hanover-based firm which also makes fuel-injection systems and transmission-control units. it plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020. a possible separation of its so-called powertrain business related to combustion engines is not on the agenda, cfo schaefer said. investment banks have presented various ideas over the last couple of months, but no specific blueprint has emerged so far, a person familiar with the matter said. ‚Äúwe highlight the pent-up strategic optionality of any potential future spin-offs of individual business units which could unlock value,‚Äù london-based hsbc said in a jan. 4 note, maintaining its ‚Äúbuy‚Äù recommendation on continental stock. shares in the group, which is 46 percent-controlled by the family that owns ball bearings maker schaeffler ( sha_p.de ), jumped as much as 7.9 percent to a record high of 257.40 euros following the report, and closed 5.4 percent higher at 251.3 euros. continental said a year ago it was reviewing its strategy for its powertrain division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations. but it has also pledged to keep developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices. bloomberg earlier reported continental was in exploratory talks with advisers on a major overhaul or even a breakup of its business, citing people familiar with the matter. it said continental could create a holding company for its divisions and then list shares of the more profitable units, such as the tire business, or combine some operations with rivals. ‚Äúas of today, it is wide open if and which changes could result from these early evaluations,‚Äù continental said. ‚Äúto date, there are no plans which could be submitted for approval.‚Äù reporting by andreas cremer and jan schwartz; writing by arno schuetze and maria sheahan; editing by jane merriman, keith weir, william maclean"

But I didn‚Äôt get much time with it.The car is much better looking in person, than in pictures.I didn‚Äôt really like not having basic mechanical latches for the trunk and hood, and glove box, and needing to use the screen. But maybe if they added a smartwatch app that allowed you to simply pass the watch near them to open? The steering wheel and AC adjustments were pretty neat, but not sure how well that would work to adjust while driving.They make great products overall, but seem to over complicate things that should be simple.Wish they would make a $20k EV, with just basic features and not a lot of unnecessary fancy tech, and unnecessarily quick acceleration. 6-7 seconds is plenty quick for a daily driver. Just give a couple basic gages for speed and kWh remaining.By 2020, I‚Äôll see what they have to offer for the Model 3, and hopefully some options will be more alacart and not all bundled together.In the meantime, I did sign up to get notified when the Model 3 will be available for a test drive.

1,"(reuters) - california said on friday it would ramp up efforts to boost electric vehicles even as it holds talks with the trump administration over the fate of fuel efficiency standards through 2025. california governor jerry brown signed an executive order ‚Äúto curb carbon pollution from cars and trucks and boost the number of zero-emission vehicles driven in california.‚Äù brown set a new target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in california by 2030, up from a prior target of 1.5 million by 2025. brown wants the state to spend $2.5 billion over eight years to add 250,000 vehicle charging stations and 200 hydrogen fueling stations by 2025. automakers have announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to add dozens of new ev models. the push comes as the trump administration is considering rolling back the 2022-2025 fuel efficiency standards. officials from the california air resources board (carb) and administration held a new round of talks earlier this week to discuss the vehicle requirements. carb chair mary nichols told reporters on friday on a conference call the administration has not made any specific proposals to reduce requirements. nichols said there‚Äôs been a ‚Äúgeneral conversation about the trump administration‚Äôs desire to do something‚Äù to indicate sympathy with automakers who say they have problems meeting the standards. carb does not believe standards should be lowered but is willing to discuss modifications if warranted. ‚Äúabsent any such evidence, we will certainly resist any changes,‚Äù nichols said. environmental protection agency air office chief bill wehrum said thursday the goal of the california meetings was to keep national standards. ‚Äúwhat we‚Äôre talking about is whether adjustments need to be made,‚Äù wehrum said. ‚Äúwe want to stay aligned with california.‚Äù california, joined by nearly a dozen other states, could seek to enforce existing emissions rules, even if the trump administration softens the federal 2022-2025 requirements. automakers want the white house and california to reach agreement because a legal battle over the rules could result in lengthy uncertainly for the industry. they want changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in u.s. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. a group representing general motors co, volkswagen ag ( vowg_p.de ), toyota motor corp and other automakers has encouraged more talks in hopes an agreement is reached. reporting by david shepardson; editing by alistair bell"

meaning turquoise hill because of the staining of the rocks by oxidised copper - rarely occur in isolation. that means, for some miners, the chances of finding another make the east asian nation worth a calculated gamble, especially given its proximity to the world‚Äôs biggest copper consumer, china. the new charge is led by a group of about half a dozen smaller players, including australia‚Äôs xanadu mines ( xam.ax ), canada‚Äôs kincora copper ( kcc.v ) and u.s. company wood capital partners, which have higher risk appetites and are seeking to steal a march on competitors. wood capital partners, set up by two former citigroup bankers and specialised in acquiring distressed assets, told reuters it had invested‚Äúseveral million dollars‚Äù in exploration territory in the southern gobi. co-ceo and managing partner stephen dizard said the firm bought the concession - which is 364 square km, or about six times the size of manhattan - from a frontier markets fund which was in liquidation. he wanted to get into mongolia ahead of a rush driven by the global hunt for new copper. he said miners would become increasingly confident in buying assets in the country because the economy was slowly improving, aided by an international monetary fund bailout. ‚Äúit (mongolia) was distressed financially and distressed across the sector,‚Äù dizard added.‚Äúwe took the view, the situation had to improve. it has.‚Äù beginning in march and april, he said the company‚Äôs drilling budget would be‚Äúa minimum of a seven-figure number‚Äù. sam spring, ceo of kincora, said it raised about $4.5 million (¬£3.2 million) last year to fund its mongolian exploration. the company, which has licences for more than 1,400 square km of land, drilled 6,000 metres last year and results were promising, and that it would step up activity in late march or early april. ‚Äúwe‚Äôve started to see a change of investor sentiment. there is increasing infrastructure and hopefully we are seeing tailwinds rather than headwinds,‚Äù added spring, who describes mongolia as one of the last frontiers for top-quality copper assets. andrew stewart, ceo of xanadu, thinks he will be able to gather enough information over the coming months to determine whether he can justify establishing a mine in the country. he is planning drilling using four rigs compared with two last year.‚Äúmongolia is very good because it has the prospectivity,‚Äù he said. desert labyrinth the dream is another discovery on the scale of rio tinto‚Äôs oyu tolgoi - a chain of deposits in the southern gobi, about 550 km south of the capital ulaanbaatar and 80 km north of the border with china. but even rio tinto ( rio.l ) ( rio.ax ), which is relying on mongolia to drive growth after committing about $12 billion to the project, only resumed exploration there last year after a five-year hiatus during the copper market downturn. the anglo-australian miner says it has still to make any return on its investment, but in january it announced an exploration office in ulaanbaatar, its first formal office in the capital. this was a symbolic move intended to underline to the government its commitment to the country, according to industry sources. rio tinto says the office will employ 80 staff and cover technology as well as exploration. to make up for dwindling output at the open pit mine rio tinto is building a labyrinth of underground tunnels that will increase annual output to 560,000 tonnes, about three times current production from the open pit. ramping up the underground operations will begin around the start of the next decade. as well as the market downturn, rio tinto has had to contend with wrangles with the mongolian government over taxes and power supply. the mine is jointly owned by the government, with 34 percent, and turquoise hill resources ( trq.to ) with 66 percent. turquoise hill is in turn 51 percent-owned by rio tinto. rio tinto ceo jean-sebastien jacques said problems were inevitable but his company was there for the long haul. slideshow (3 images) ‚Äúmy personal experience over the last five years is, that you know, lots of issues as you would expect, but each time we have been able to work through them,‚Äù he said last month. ‚Äúi‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to be easy.‚Äù -40c to 40c miners and political analysts say that, while the economy in mongolia is gradually improving, the legal system is opaque and frequent changes in government since the country became a democracy three decades ago have created policy uncertainty, making investors wary. the mongolian mining ministry did not respond to reuters requests for comment. miners must also deal with temperatures that can swing from -40c to 40c, and ferocious winds that can last for days. as a result, they tend to limit drilling programmes in the gobi to between late march and november. by contrast, drilling can take place all year round in chile and other latin american countries. such considerations have deterred most miners for many years. bhp chief executive andrew mackenzie, for example, told reuters his preference was for safe jurisdictions, namely the americas. he described mongolia as‚Äúpotentially very prospective but not without security and geopolitical challenges‚Äù. but copper market conditions are slowly driving change. rio tinto‚Äôs renewed activity and the exploration of rivals comes as demand increases for a metal needed in large quantities for the electric-vehicle and renewable energy industries. copper prices cmcu3 have rebounded to nearly $7,000 a tonne from lows around $4,300 a tonne hit in early 2016, which was their weakest since 2009. at the same time, chile‚Äôs long-exploited ore bodies are ageing and challenged by arsenic concentrations and proximity to large populations. mine workers there have also been demanding higher wages, adding to costs. such is the draw of mongolia - which has the same type of‚Äúporphyry‚Äù rock formations - that even chile‚Äôs giant state copper company codelco has said it is considering investing in the asian nation. an advantage of the porphyry formations is that the copper is often accompanied by gold, which can effectively subsidise the copper production. ‚Äúmongolia represents a very prospective region for copper deposits of the porphyry type,‚Äù said jamie wilkinson, research leader in mineral deposits at london‚Äôs natural history museum. ‚Äúoyu tolgoi was found in 2001. there have been some small discoveries since then but nothing on the same scale. there is lots of potential for future discoveries.‚Äù ‚Äònot for faint-hearted‚Äô however, while there may be geological potential, there is no guarantee of unearthing commercial volumes of copper, and luck is always a significant factor. the interest from overseas explorers, if sustained, could nonetheless prove crucial for mongolia itself, which is heavily dependent on commodities and had to turn to the imf last year following a collapse in foreign investment. about 30 percent of its 3 million people live in poverty, according to 2016 figures from the world bank and mongolia‚Äôs national statistical office. moody‚Äôs raised the country‚Äôs sovereign debt rating by a notch in january, following the imf bailout deal, but it is still deep in junk territory. the deal has helped the country pay off its sovereign debt and stabilised the local currency, the tugrik, but required ulaanbaatar to introduce measures such as higher taxes and cuts to social welfare. iain watt, ceo of mining business igi‚Äôs uk operations, said it too was exploring possibilities in mongolia, as well as central asia, and that there was clear potential for investors. ‚Äúmongolia is definitely on the up - but it‚Äôs not for the faint-hearted.‚Äù reporting by barbara lewis in london; additional reporting by terrence edwards in ulaanbaatar and karin strohecker in london; editing by pravin char"

1,"(the opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters.) by clyde russell launceston, australia, feb 26 - it seems coal miners are adopting one of two disparate strategies, either exit the business in a highly visible way to buff up your climate credentials, or sit tight, keep as quiet as possible and rake in the cash. an example of the public exit from the business is south32 , the perth-based miner spun out of bhp billiton which is in the process of selling out of its thermal coal assets in south africa. mike fraser, south32‚Äôs president and chief operating office for south africa, told reuters earlier this month that the company was aiming to sell its coal assets because it ‚Äúdid not believe in the commodity.‚Äù it would also be better if the coal mines were majority-owned by black investors, fraser said. this is a reasonable recognition that it‚Äôs increasingly hard for companies without black investors to do business in south africa, given its laws and rules aimed at promoting the economic interests of the majority population following centuries of discrimination under first colonial and then white-minority rule. south32 joins anglo american in getting out of south african coal, with the london-listed miner selling the last of its domestic coal assets to a majority black-owned company in january. anglo american will continue to export coal from south africa, but it will no longer be a participant in supplying the domestic market, which is dominated by the state power utility eskom. perhaps it‚Äôs not surprising that the two major coal asset sales this year are taking place in south africa, given the ongoing dispute between the government and the mining industry over a new mining charter and the requirements to increase the participation of black investors. but rio tinto also decided to exit its australian coal business, selling out to yancoal australia and glencore. if there is a trend at play here, it‚Äôs that diversified miners are the ones most likely to exit coal, and some have cited the risks of being in an increasingly unpopular business. activists and other investors are ramping up pressure on fund managers and sovereign wealth funds to divest from companies that are in coal. given coal was a tiny part of rio‚Äôs business, exiting the industry makes sense, especially if you can then tout yourself as a miner of metals that will be part of the electric vehicle and battery revolution. risking ire the other choice is to stay in coal and try to mitigate any public backlash. bhp and its alliance partner mitsubishi are the world‚Äôs largest exporters of coking coal, used to make steel, and there are no signs that the miner intends to exit the business. same goes for glencore, and both these companies are probably calculating that the monetary rewards from coal still outweigh any public backlash. benjamin sporton, chief executive of industry group the world coal association, told reuters in an interview on monday that there was a positive mood among many coal miners. while sporton said coal producers acknowledge that the market is shrinking in europe and faces a huge challenge from cheap natural gas in the united states, asia is presenting good opportunities. ‚Äúour membership see a strong future in asia,‚Äù he said, citing expectations that china and india will remain major importers of both thermal and coking coal, while demand will also be boosted by newer consumers in asia, such as vietnam and pakistan. the absence of major new coal mines and indonesia reducing exports to fuel domestic demand also means that supply to seaborne markets is likely to be constrained in coming years, even if there is a slowdown in the construction of new coal-fired generators. the reality for many existing coal miners is that conditions now are as good as they have been in living memory. the price of thermal coal is strong, with the asian thermal benchmark newcastle weekly index ending on feb. 23 at $110.60 a tonne, the highest in six years. costs are also down, with the industry having cut every sliver of fat during the five years of declining prices from 2011 to 2015. an example of the strong conditions for coal miners is australia‚Äôs whitehaven coal, which on feb. 16 reported that its first-half underlying profit rose by about 63 percent to a$257.2 million ($204 million). it also paid a dividend for the first time since 2012. for coal miners who can take the heat of the public opinion kitchen these are good times. for those who no longer see coal as part of the future, they can sell out, at prices higher than what they might have expected a few years, and at the same time hopefully gain some climate-change credibility.

1,"april 11, 2018 / 7:20 pm / updated an hour ago exclusive - tesla targets november 2019 for start of model y production: sources alexandria sage 5 min read  san francisco (reuters) - tesla inc ( tsla.o ) is targeting november 2019 as the start of production for its model y sport utility vehicle, with production in china to begin two years later, two sources told reuters this week, shedding some light on the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs next project that could tax its resources and capacity. a tesla dealership is seen in west drayton, just outside london, britain, february 7, 2018. reuters/hannah mckay  reuters has learned the silicon valley company led by chief executive elon musk is accepting preliminary bids for supplier contracts on the model y, a compact crossover companion to the model 3 sedan. tesla has given suppliers scant details about the programme and had not provided a production time frame, but has now indicated the vehicle would begin to be built at its fremont, california, plant in november of next year, the two sources with knowledge of the supply chain said.  tesla declined to comment.  the new model y details show that tesla is pushing ahead on plans to build a new vehicle even as it struggles to produce the model 3, which launched in july. despite initially attracting about 500,000 advance orders in the form of refundable deposits, the sedan‚Äôs launch has been plagued by delays and manufacturing bottlenecks, postponing tesla‚Äôs anticipated revenue stream and exacerbating a cash crunch for the money-losing company.  earlier this month, tesla tried to reassure investors, saying its weekly model 3 output had doubled during the first quarter and that production rates would accelerate through the second quarter to 5,000 units per week, or about 250,000 vehicles per year.  competitive bidding is a crucial early step in the complicated process of automotive manufacturing. after the automaker discloses its plans, suppliers compete based on factors including cost and technology.  tesla issued to suppliers what is known as a ‚Äúrequest for information,‚Äù or rfi, which gives a directional view of what will be needed.  with a new car model, automakers normally choose parts suppliers two to two-and-a-half years before the start of production. at about one-and-a-half years away, a november 2019 start date for the model y would be considered ‚Äúaggressive, but possible,‚Äù said one of the sources. a shorter timeline is potentially feasible, the source said, as the model y will be built on the same platform as the model 3.  tesla is known for its aggressive timelines and high risk-tolerance in order to get cars to market quicker. to save time and cost, tesla made the risky bet to skip a pre-production testing phase for the model 3 in order to advance straight to production tooling, which is harder to fix if problems arise, as reuters first reported last year.  1 million model ys?  the model y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for tesla, which also launched a tesla semi and a new roadster in recent months. it is spending to build out its gigafactory battery factory in nevada, where battery module assembly issues have contributed to model 3 delays, and also expects to build a factory in china in the near future.  tesla has said it will not need to raise additional funds this year. but moody‚Äôs cited the likelihood of a capital raise of more than $2 billion in its downgrade of the company last month, spurred by concerns about cash reserves and tesla‚Äôs ability to meet production targets. the company burned through $3.4 billion last year.  without giving a time frame, musk in february told analysts the company would aim for production capacity of 1 million model ys per year.  the two sources said suppliers could be estimating an annual production of 500,000 vehicles in the united states, with much lower volume in china, likely in the tens of thousands. building 500,000 model ys per year would be the equivalent of what musk has planned for total production in fremont by the end of this year, although the company is nowhere near that volume.  suppliers generally use automakers‚Äô production targets to formulate a good guess on how many vehicles will actually be built, based on the individual automaker‚Äôs capability to execute and consumer demand. one of the sources said tesla‚Äôs rfi was light on details compared with other automakers, and did not provide volume estimates for the model y.  musk said in february that capital investments related to the suv would begin towards the end of 2018. tesla has said its current factory in fremont could produce 10,000 vehicles a week - what the company hopes it will build in the model 3 alone some time in 2018 - without the need for a new building, although some in the industry believe there is not enough room at the plant to support that volume.  any major model y programme would likely require a new facility, although low volume of the model y could be built on the existing model 3 line, the sources said. reporting by alexandria sage; editing by matthew lewis"
1,"san francisco, may 25 (reuters) - tesla inc on friday asked a court to dismiss a securities fraud lawsuit by shareholders who said the electric vehicle maker gave false public statements about the progress of producing its new model 3 sedan. in a filing in federal court in san francisco, tesla said that its statements about the challenges the company faced with model 3 were ""frank and in plain language,"" including repeated disclosures by chief executive elon musk of ""production hell."" tesla did not seek to hide the truth, its motion to dismiss said. the company says its model 3 has experienced numerous ""bottlenecks"" from problems with tesla's battery module process at its nevada gigafactory to general assembly at its fremont plant. tesla is under pressure to deliver the model 3 to reap revenue and stem massive spending that has put tesla's finances in the red. the ramp of the model 3, tesla said in the court filing, was ""the first of its kind,"" with difficulties likely to crop up after it got underway. the lawsuit filed last october seeks class action status for shareholders who bought tesla stock between may 4, 2016 through october 6, 2017, inclusive. it said shareholders bought ""artificially inflated"" shares because musk and other executives misled them with their statements. tesla made such statements during the lead-up to, and early production of, its model 3 sedan and failed to disclose that the company was ""woefully unprepared"" for the vehicle's production, the lawsuit said. a hearing is scheduled for august. the tesla response chronicled disclosures of production bottlenecks the company faced in its third quarter of 2017 when it fell short of its targets. tesla's statements that its model 3 production was ""on track"" in may and august of 2017 - which plaintiffs argue were false - were made before production problems began to surface, tesla argued. tesla said its ""good faith belief"" in the model 3 program is reflected in everything it has done: a $4 billion investment, the build-out of its gigafactory battery factory in nevada and the high-volume equipment it commissioned.

If that was the case, then people would only buy very basic cars which have relatively little that can go wrong with them. Nobody would be buying more expensive cars if reliability was more important than everything else.CR's ratings are biased against Tesla in several ways.

both are examples of dominant producers of a commodity trying to extract more wealth from that position. it‚Äôs also likely that similar to the ultimate disaster that befell ousted thai prime minister yingluck shinawatra, the drc‚Äôs attempts to extract more from cobalt will unleash a wave of unintended consequences, none of which will be positive for the government in kinshasa. cobalt has gone from a minor metal with an almost non-existent public profile to the major threat to the future of the switch to electric vehicles and battery storage for electricity. this is because cobalt is a key ingredient in the current technology lithium-ion batteries essential for both cars and electricity storage, and the drc produces more than half of the world‚Äôs supply. the drc is hardly a paragon of stable government, with president joseph kabila still refusing to hold elections even though his term expired two years ago. much of the country remains beyond the control of the central government and its recent history has seen numerous conflicts that involved several neighbouring countries and various armed factions. however, kabila‚Äôs government has made it clear that it now wants a greater share of the revenue from its vast reserves of cobalt, with the country producing 73,940 tonnes of the metal last year, a jump of 15.5 percent from 2016. parliament has approved a new mining code that increases royalties five-fold to 10 percent, and removes a stability clause in the current law that protects miners from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for 10 years. the code still has to be signed into law by kabila, and miners active in the country, including glencore and ivanhoe mines, are lobbying for changes and talks about future taxation arrangements. the drc‚Äôs state-owned miner gecamines also wants to re-negotiate contracts with international partners to secure a bigger share of revenues. the drc situation occupied much of the recent investing in african mining indaba conference in cape town, with miners in attendance privately expressing fears that the drc would ultimately move down the road to full nationalisation of the industry. thai precedent what does this have in common with yingluck‚Äôs policy of subsidising thai rice farmers, a policy she introduced to win the support of the rural population who helped her to election victory in july 2011? yingluck‚Äôs government saw what they thought was an opportunity to make global rice consumers pay more for the staple grain, which would allow them to pay generous subsidies to rural farmers. at the time, thailand was the world‚Äôs largest exporter of rice, with a market share above 50 percent, and there was real market concern not only of rising prices, but also of shortages, much like today with cobalt. but what happened was that as soon as the new thai government tried to raise export prices, the country became the supplier of last resort and buyers moved increasingly to competitors such as vietnam and india. ultimately the thai government spent billions of dollars buying rice it couldn‚Äôt sell, forcing it to stockpile millions of tonnes of the grain, leading to fiscal pressure and allegations of mismanagement that helped spur the military takeover that removed yingluck in may 2014. this isn‚Äôt suggesting that the drc is heading toward a military coup, but there are similar dynamics starting to play out. the first is that the hunt for cobalt outside the drc is going to be massively stepped up, with the united states and sweden among those countries that have already said they are targeting new deposits of the metal. secondly, huge amounts of capital are about to flow into finding alternatives to using cobalt in batteries, or at least reducing the amount of cobalt used for each unit. thirdly, the drc is likely to suffer an investment boycott if it goes ahead and implements terms that punish the mining companies that have taken a risk and put their money into developing the central african nation‚Äôs resources. numerous commentators have pointed out that there is still a cobalt supply crunch on the horizon, as new mines, improved battery technologies and extensive recycling of used batteries is likely to still leave a shortfall of cobalt, assuming the forecasts for electric cars and power-storage batteries are accurate. this may be the case, but past experience has shown that when the price signal is strong enough, the response tends to happen far more quickly than anticipated. right now, the price signal is flashing red, with london cobalt futures ending at $81,500 a tonne on feb. 16, up 8.3 percent so far this year, but also up an astonishing 275 percent since the low of $21,750 from february, 2016. the drc is in pole position to benefit from the expected surge in demand for cobalt, but only if it decides to pursue polices that don‚Äôt alienate mining companies and encourage the rapid development of alternatives. editing by joseph radford"
