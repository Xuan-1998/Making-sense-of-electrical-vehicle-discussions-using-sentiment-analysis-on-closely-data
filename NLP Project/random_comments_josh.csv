For example, Model 3 Standard Plus used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for the Autopilot option. It now costs $39,500, with Autopilot included.\n\nWe think including Autopilot is very important because our data strongly indicates that the chance of an accident is much lower when Autopilot is enabled. Autopilot also dramatically improves the quality of the driving experience, especially in heavy traffic, as thousands of our customers frequently describe online.\n. . .\nBob Wilson"", 'Here\'s the InsideEVs News report:\n\n""Tesla Announces Model 3 Leasing, Autopilot Now Standard""\n\nWe\'ll have to wait to have this confirmed by someone attempting to buy one, but as far as I can tell, the $35,000 is no longer available for order. Tesla\'s press release says that going forward, all Tesla cars will have Autopilot as standard equipment, so that price will be added in to the Standard Range Model 3, which can now only be ordered at a Tesla Store or over the phone. You can no longer order the SR TM3 online; the SR+ (Standard Range Plus) is the lowest trim level that can be ordered online.\n\nGiven Tesla\'s history, if they\'ve removed the SR TM3 from the website and made it an ""off menu"" option only, that strongly suggests it will soon entirely disappear.\n\nSo, if you\'ve been waiting to get a Standard Range Tesla Model 3... better call and order it today! But likely you\'ll have to pay something like $37k base price, and not $35k.', 'When Tesla sent the usual ""How did we do it?"" survey, I gave them high marks.

They should be better than that, but I guess they have their reasons.\nThe $35,000 base price Model 3 was available for a limited time, but (a) now it\'s available only as an ""off-menu"" order at a store or by phone. If you were told by a Tesla rep that the ""base price"" was $39,900, then the rep lied to you. (b) As I understand it, Tesla quite recently raised the prices slightly across the board -- some are saying that\'s in response to Trump\'s tariffs -- and the base price is now $35,400.\n\nNow, that doesn\'t include delivery fee, which as I understand it is $1200... but the MSRP quoted by other auto makers includes neither delivery nor dealer prep fees. At least Tesla includes prep charges in the delivery fee.\n\nHowever, what you got wasn\'t a base Standard Range Model 3, but rather a ""Standard Range Plus""; thus the $4500 upcharge. Not sure why you\'re calling that ""Tesla BS""... you really did get a better car than the base ""Standard Range"" Model 3, even if that wasn\'t your intent.\n\nBut you do have an option! Tesla is offering a 7-day return policy. If you really think you\'ve been jerked around, then tell them you want to return the car, and trade it for the off-menu base $35,400 Model 3. Well, if you want red paint, then there\'s an extra charge for that, so you still won\'t be getting the absolute lowest possible price on a Model 3.\n\nAnyway, whatever you decide, I hope you have many years of happy driving with your Model 3!', ""This is the invoice I received 2 days ago, when buying... (personally, I never believed there would be a $35k model).\nYes, they charge for the upgrade. Yes, they say you can special-order the cloth model, or whatever it was going to be.

It\'s an ""off-menu"" order only, available if you order by phone or if you visit your local Tesla Store. But they\'re no longer offering the cloth fabric seats; the base $35,400 Model 3 is now an electronically limited Standard Range Plus, so it will have all the same hardware and interior, altho some things (for example, some of the many speakers inside) will be non-functional. (I\'m curious about the fog lamps, which were not part of the original SR package, but are included in the SR+. Are those functional on what is now the SR, or have they been disabled?)\n\nThe upsell for $4500 for the ""Standard Range Plus Rear-Wheel Drive"" is the charge for getting the ""Standard Range Plus"" version of the Model 3, which is the cheapest version available on the website, but it\'s not the cheapest available for an off-menu order.\n\nIf you choose to reject the valuable information I\'m giving you, then that\'s on you.

You getting upset and defensive about your buying choice, arguing on the basis of emotion rather than facts or rational thinking, doesn\'t change reality.\n\nChoice-supportive bias or post-purchase rationalization is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected and/or to demote the forgone options. It is part of Cognitive science, and is a distinct cognitive bias that occurs once a decision is made. For example, if a person chooses option A instead of option B, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option A while amplifying or subscribing new negative faults to option B. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option A and not notice or de-emphasize those of option B.\n--Wikipedia: ""Choice-supportive bias""', ""OMG - you are insane!

The large screen is responsive, bright, and clear. The app is really useful. I like the charge and precondition scheduling, though it could be better. And I’m sure they will improve it with the OTA.\n\n\n5.) the backup camera is best I’ve seen in a car.\n\n\n6.) the exterior design. At first I was not a fan of the design from seeing it online. In person it really made a better impression. It’s not as good looking as the S, or other cars. But for a family sedan, it’s quite pretty.\n\n\n7.) safety. I’ve not needed, thank goddess, but one of the main reasons I chose the 3 was it’s high safety rating.\n\n\n8.) no range anxiety. I came from a low range EV, and it’s so nice to be able to use the heat and not worry at all about it.\n\n\n9.) ride quality is very smooth and comfortable.\n\n\n10.) good size trunk. And amount of storage. It’s impressive for a sedan.\n\n\n11.) I’m impressed with how fast the car heats up. And the heated seats are great.\n\n\nDislikes:\n\n1.) no driver’s display. Having just the center screen is not as bad as I thought it would be, and I’ve gotten used to it, but it’s like having Stockholm Syndrome. A drivers cluster or HUD would be better. Especially for showing the car and surrounding traffic. And navigation.\n\n\n2.) memory seats that don’t really work. I tried the “Easy entry/exit” setting, but it kept screwing up my drivers setting profile, and I was constantly having to readjust my seat. I had to turn that off.\n\n\n3.) automatic garage door opener. Kind of cool, but only if you always park in your garage. I use my garage as a wood shop and for other projects, and sometimes have to park in my driveway. The car doesn’t have any idea about the open/close status of the garage door. So, when pulling away from the house it pings to close the door, but the door is already closed, so it opens. If I don’t notice my garage door is open all day. I turned that off.\n\n\n4.) rear seat belt latches. They are sunk into the seats and hard to get to if you have kids booster seats. My kids struggle to buckle their own belts. It wasn’t a problem in my Spark EV, and not an issue in the minivan.\n\n\n5.) no option to leave the charge port unlocked. I regularly use the J1772 adapter and it’s a pain to get the charge port to unlock. Also, I have to remember to bring my fob or phone out to the car to move the charging cable from my car to our van.\n\n\n6.) no button for the glove box. It’s stupid.\n\n\n7.) the windshield wipers need more granular speed control. And a physical control for changing the speed. The Automatic setting kind of works, but only if it’s a medium to heavy amount of rain. In mist and light rain, it just doesn’t work too well. Nor when it has finished raining but the roads are still wet and you are getting tire spray from the cars in front. I am constantly using the physical mist button on the front, or having to set it to a manual speed. They are apparently collecting data for machine learning to improve it, but haven’t rolled out an update for it yet, as far as I can tell. Not convinced they can get to where they should be, without a dedicated rain sensor. The cameras in my car were tricked into wiping the windshield when it was completely dry, by the patterns of a parking garage wall. Also, is it going to adjust it’s learning to my preferences specifically, and local climate, or a conglomerate from the fleet? What if I like rain cleared faster than other people? Or slower? Guess we’ll find out. It’s something you notice a lot when you live in a temperate rain forest (PNW).\n\n\n8.) Not as sporty as I had hoped. It’s been shown that, with some mods, the 3 can hold its own against other comparable “sports sedans” on the track. But for me the stock suspension setup could use improvement. Gets a lot of body roll in corners, even with the low CG. But the soft suspension does give a comfortable ride for day to day driving.\n\n\n9.) phone integration is not very good. Just add CarPlay and be done with it.\n\n\n10.) the high cost. It’s a good car, but not $50k good.\n\nIf you stayed with me this long, I leave you with this:\n\nThis is the nicest car I have ever bought. The good outweighs the bad, which are mostly nitpicks. I think if the car wasn’t so expensive, I wouldn’t even care. Do I love it? Some days. I want to love it more, but mostly it’s just a means of conveyance.

The rest of the trip was normal car behavior.\nThe distribution and J1772 ESVEs at the hotel/motel were powered off and this was Sunday. We weren\'t sure we\'d get them turned on Monday so I drove downtown to use the Plano SuperCharger. Sunday afternoon it was very busy and I picked up a quick charge but by 7PM it was all but empty and there were restaurants calling my name. Open question, if you use the phone app to stop charging before reaching the car, do you still get idle or other tier 1 charges?\nShreveport never charged for our session ... Thanks TESLA.\nWe stopped at Vicksburg and put the portable kennel up on a nearby RV park but we didn\'t have the right electrical plug for 30A service. Using 12A, 120VAC it was obvious we were losing charge and it wasn\'t clear we\'d have enough to reach Perl MS the next morning. So I took a midnight trip to Perl to put on a strong charge, 144 mi battery range at the RV park and left the kennel in operation. I visited the casino and left with an extra $79 and took at nap in the room. With unusual speed, my wife got ready quickly to see her dogs and we were on the road by 8AM.\nWe didn\'t realize how bad the I-20 backup would be so we took a detour and in the heat, AC was necessary. Then about 20 miles beyond the construction, another backup as a truck had rolled off the road and a fire truck was blocking lanes. Autopilot worked great and someone in a tall work truck rolled down their window to ask if I was driving without using my hands . . . he was impressed. We barely found the Birmingham SuperChargers which due to construction was accessible by only one road. The battery was so low we initially lost AC. Once we had enough to reach home, we were off. I used the map to take short-cuts in Birmingham and Huntsville.\nLESSONS LEARNED\n\nFirst segment should be from a non-SuperCharger source, a hotel/motel or RV park, where a full charge can be put on the car. This avoids the more expensive, slower tier 1, charge.\n\nAlways leave with a 30 mi reserve range to the next SuperCharger but have handy the PlugShare map of RV parks, J1772, and distribution chargers along the route. If the reserve range reaches 10 mi, divert to these alternate charging sources.\n\nIf using an RV park, make sure you have a set of 30A plugs and/or adapters. There are different styles.\n\nBob Wilson', ""I didn't like the quality of my first report so I repeated it using iPhone, 'TIME-LAPSE' to record the session:\n\nStandard Range Plus Model 3, V19.16.2\nclimate control was off\n20 mi indicated battery range at start\n237 mi stopped recording data in spreadsheet\nframe numbers to reconstruct true time\nkW rate\nmi/hr rate\nbattery mi\nfirst and last frame times\nHere is the battery range in miles during the session:\n\nOne goal is resolving the optimum charge session for cost and speed, the green dashed rectangular box:\ntoo short duration - the ramp up slows getting back on the road. It is cheapest BUT a slower trip end-to-end speed.\ntoo long duration - the battery taper slows getting back on the road. It is also more expensive while giving a slower trip end-to-end speed.\nAdding the charge and travel time at 65 mph with the distance covered gives a curve showing the optimum, battery charge:\n\nWhat this means is attempts to charge to the vehicle maximum range is both expensive and causes the trip to take longer. It is slightly faster and cheaper to go shorter distance, SuperCharger-to-SuperCharge when in SuperCharger mode. This does not apply on the first trip of the day leaving with the car at maximum charge.\n\nThis busy chart combines the costs and battery mi level with the X-axis, charge rate:\n\n$0.025/mi = $2.50/100 mi - optimum route, expected cost. With gas at $2.50/gal, in effect, 100 MPG equivalent.\nlonger distance legs will give a slower trip time and higher cost but if you have to reach a SuperCharger, there is only one alternative . . . slower speed than 65 mph. But it will be faster than stopped or using an L1 or L2 charger.\nOn long range trips that require multiple SuperCharger sessions, there may be more than one route. Choose the route with the closest SuperChargers and do multiple, short charges. Avoid routes that have a lot of maximum range segments.\n\nBob Wilson""]","['Jun 2, 2019', 'Jun 11, 2019']"

Tesla could simply choose to send more of its MS and MX production to Canada and overseas, while continuing to push out as many TM3 units to U.S. buyers as it possibly can. Tesla already voluntarily (at least according to what the company claims) reduced MS/MX production by 10% in the latter half of last year, in order to reassign some engineers and workers to maximize the effort to ramp up TM3 production. Would it be that big a surprise if they chose to reduce MS/MX sales even more this year, by sending a lopsided number to Canada, and to overseas markets?\n\nTesla could even, in theory, send some TM3 units to Canada and overseas. However, I don\'t think they\'ll do that before passing the 200,000 milestone, as it would violate the priority they have advertised for who on the reservation list gets served first. They have pretty clearly said that U.S. customers get served first. Of course, there\'s no law that says they can\'t change their minds, but that would generate some pretty strong negative publicity for them, so I don\'t think they will.\n-\nClick to expand...\nWe don\'t know the exact number of current sales, but it is probably somewhere between 165k and 170k. Inside EVs estimates through this January are 163k. Other sources think the number is higher. So I\'ll meet in the middle and say Tesla has an available 35,000 sales before they hit 200,000 in the US.\n\nTesla has said that they will be producing 2500/week by the end of this quarter. And 5000/week by the end of next quarter.\n\nIn order to have any chance of delaying the threshold until Q3, I have to assume some fairly pessimistic US sales numbers for the next 5 months. Production might be higher than the following but these are just example numbers in order to hit Q3 rebate trigger:\n\n1000/week\nFeb 2018: 4000\n\n1125/week\nMarch 2018: 4500\n\n1500/week\nApril 2018: 6000\n\n1500/week\nMay 2018: 7000\n\n2,000/week\nJune 2018: 8,000\n\nTotal Model 3 sales for Feb-June 2018: 29,500\n\nAs you can see, these numbers I\'ve thrown out there are less than half production targets. Roughly 2,000/week production in May assuming the current 3-5 weeks from configure to delivery continues. If the ""delay until Q3"" theory holds true, production would then rise quickly in June for delivery in July.\n\nThere are basically 2 ways they could hit these numbers:\n- Production continues to be much lower than they are shooting for.\n- A significant portion of Model 3 production is sent into Canada and other markets starting in Q2.\n\nOf course, even at the relatively low production numbers above, they would still hit ~30,000 units. So:\n- Canadian/European sales of the Model 3 would need to begin very soon, and would need to soak up 40-50% of deliveries. Canadian deliveries on their own wouldn\'t offset sales enough. And S/X deliveries in the US would need to drop by at least 40%. Canadian delivery estimates have indeed moved up to Mid-2018. But only for the LR version I believe. And that isn\'t soon enough to really help.\n- Assuming all Model 3 deliveries are for the US only, Model S and X would basically need to ship less than 6,000 units combined in the US over 5 months. It\'s possible, but that would be off about 70% from last year.\n\nYou\'re right that it is technically possible. If they\'re going to do it, they need to actually announce they are doing so. I hope they do for the sake of myself and others wanting the Short Range Model 3. But that would be 5 months of much lower deliveries for S, X and 3 in the US than expected. I\'m not sure it\'s the right move for Tesla financially or PR wise.\n\nThey\'re kind of in between a rock and hard place here for US deliveries. Do they further delay production? Stop fulfilling Model S/X orders? Start to ship the high end model 3 overseas? No matter the tactic, they\'re gonna piss off someone, somewhere lol. They want to avoid pissing off their current customers and those looking to max out the vehicle with options. Better to piss off those buying the less profitable, lower end model. Since that model was priced to be competitive even without tax breaks anyways.\n\nThey also probably hope they\'ll convince some future SR owners to go for the LR model.

My opinion is Tesla FSD will never be real Full Self Driving, in a number of years they may roll out more features on their A/P suite, however you have to decide of those buggy features are really worth your money. Many of the features are practically worthless in the real world unless they work in a ratio somewhere around two to the minus ninth. Looking at the other FSD players mainly Waymo, and Cruise Automation both of which have much larger design teams, more money, cars with way more sensors and redundancy, and they still do not have real Full Self Driving, they are both miles closer than Tesla, but its harder than just some machine learning algorithm, programming the cheap, low power computer Tesla designed.\n\nDo not get lost in the fact Elon Promised FSD cross country trip in 2016, and I still do not remember seeing that, then the timeline pushed, and pushed.

Its the same kind of logic Trump had where he was saying he was going to force people to buy coal. Its pure duress out in the open. You can see this is the stupid failure of GE because it doubled down on loser natural gas bs.\n\nPublic is going to have to start asking for the outright end of petrol subsidies and confiscation of any claimed phony petrol profit.

Without expanding its factory, Tesla cannot manufacture any more per week. 5,000 x 52 weeks = 260,000 per year. There are a lot of other sedans, not just the Camry. Honda Civic 176,242 (first 6 months 2018), Corolla 149,805, Accord 138,290 will all outsell the Tesla 3. This ignores the fact that American car buyers have been moving away from sedans to SUVs and trucks.\n\nTesla is a remarkable company, but has not yet demonstrated that it can make money. Tesla cars are certainly sexy and appealing. However, the Tesla 3, which is now being built, stickers for $50,000 before tax credits.

The idea that SUV and trucks amount to something is BS is that was just a auto fossil fuel emissions scam based on the foot print line of lies its not because people like these vehicles more or Americans like them more it was because of fossil fuel collusion that the structurally bankrupt US ICE makers as part of the petrol retail chain cannibalized the value of their other vehicles (traditionally preferred to harder to park friction lined SUV/Trucks) to put more material value into those higher fuel consuming vehicles. But the model 3 is a better value period and that is why its sales are hugely up against ICE cars and ICE cars are down.

In my research for the ""machine gun belt"" bandolier assembly process for the Model 3 packs that George and I wrote about a while back, an insider at the GF clarified that Tesla only has one automated line set up for assembling the cells & cooling tubes into bandoliers and then assembling the bandoliers into modules.\n\nElsewhere (where, I can\'t remember) I recall that the cell/cooling tube assembly process took 10 minutes per bandolier manually and only 10 seconds via automation. With that data, we can estimate how many packs per hour Tesla can produce with one automated line (when operating at 100% efficiency)\n\n7 bandoliers per module x 4 modules per pack = 28 modules x 10 seconds/bandolier = 280 seconds per pack = 4.667 minutes/pack = 12.8 packs per hour\nAssume two 8-hr shifts per day & 6 days per week. 12.8 packs/hr x 8 hrs x 2 shifts x 6 days = 1,228 packs/week.\nAssume 80% efficiency (15% machine down time plus 5% scrap rate). 1,228 x 0.8 = 983 packs/week\n\nSo if the information about the cycle time is true and that there is currently one line working, then Tesla can only build about 1,000 packs per week until they duplicate the 1st line and get it commissioned. That gibes with the current estimated burst production rate. The inside source said the space was set up for 4 lines at full capacity. With 4 lines, Tesla could build about 4,000 packs per week and therefore build 4000 Model 3\'s per week. The ramp-up beyond 1,000 will require a) bringing on new lines and b) getting them properly commissioned. Since they hopefully learned a lot from the first line\'s problems, the 2nd (and 3rd and 4th) lines should be able to assembled, commissioned, and producing much quicker than the 1st.\n\nWhy did I assume just two shifts (no graveyard shift) and why not 7 days per week? Cleanup and maintenance. The cleanliness required to maintain the tolerances of this fine assembly is very high. A thorough cleaning has to be done daily. And service, calibration, etc required on these automated precision systems are horrendous. (If you watch videos of any modern automated assembly line, you\'ll see that you could probably eat right off the floor). Frequently one full day each week (like Sunday) is reserved for handling the bigger maintenance issues that can only be done when all lines are down. And then there are the multi-day shut-downs, usually over holiday breaks and then a 1-2 week summer shutdown for serious maintenance and/or retooling.', ""I haven't seen a single model 3 in Socal.

Tesla could simply choose to send more of its MS and MX production to Canada and overseas, while continuing to push out as many TM3 units to U.S. buyers as it possibly can. Tesla already voluntarily (at least according to what the company claims) reduced MS/MX production by 10% in the latter half of last year, in order to reassign some engineers and workers to maximize the effort to ramp up TM3 production. Would it be that big a surprise if they chose to reduce domestic MS/MX sales even more this year, by sending a lopsided number to Canada, and to overseas markets?\n\nTesla could even, in theory, send some TM3 units to Canada and overseas. However, I don't think they'll do that before passing the 200,000 milestone, as it would violate the priority they have advertised for who on the reservation list gets served first. They have pretty clearly said that U.S. customers get served first. Of course, there's no law that says they can't change their minds, but that would generate some pretty strong negative publicity for them, so I don't think they will.\n-"", ""Ok, Tesla is done with owners.

In his plant, each car starts as an electronic specification of the finished vehicle. In effect it is a box saying ""I want to be a black car with leather seats, alloy wheels, with the following options..."" As it proceeds through the production process the robots and people interrogate it to see what the chosen option is at that point. Each car can be different in theory anyway, without slowing down production.\nI admit I don\'t understand why Tesla doesn\'t handle things this way, since it\'s trying to automate everything. It does make sense to do paint spraying on multiple cars of a given color in a row, as there will be some wastage of both time and paint in switching from one color to another.

Certainly they have to use different bins/racks for different parts, but can\'t all the bins/racks for the various options be put within reach of any given robot arm?\n\nYour comment about batch processing being an old-fashioned approach isn\'t the first comment along those lines, so perhaps there is some truth to it.

The paint droplets are electrically charged, and the object being painted is given an opposite charge. This attracts the droplets to what is being painted, which greatly reduces overspray and wasted paint.\n\nBut exactly what process is used to switch from one paint color to another, I don't know. My guess is that switching colors is mostly or completely automated, controlled by valves in the feed lines, and that they just spray some of the new paint color out until the lines and nozzles are all clear of the previous color.\n\nIf they had to physically swap out nozzles and other parts by hand then that would take much longer and would be much messier.

I understand that the regenerative braking is supposed to offset the loss in repetitive acceleration to certain speed since acceleration to that speed consumes more than maintaining.\nWe typically call the indicated range, the ""guess o\' meter"" (GOM) because there is some variability that increases at values over ~30-50 miles. But if it says ""150 miles,"" it will in urban driving, give you that 150 miles, with +/- 15 miles, due to weather like cold, under 50 F, heat, over 85 F, rain, or snow.\n\nThe recommended practice is to limit the car charge, a percentage, to give regeneration ""head room"" for braking. In my case, the ~236-240 mi range, I charge to just 66%, ~154-160 miles to maximize regenerative energy recovery from braking. This is more than enough for driving around town yet I can reach the nearest Superchargers to the North, East, South, and West. I only fully charge the battery over night when I plan to drive a long distance the next day, to the Superchargers beyond the nearest ones.\n\nFor long distance, I typically add ~30 miles reserve to the next Supercharger distance. Then I adjust the highway speed to keep the reserve and avoid going below 10 miles remaining. For example, I\'ll typically get behind a truck, RV, or trailer and use dynamic cruise control to keep a safe following distance to seer around road debris.\n\nBob Wilson']","['Dec 19, 2019', 'Dec 19, 2019', 'Dec 23, 2019', 'Dec 23, 2019', 'Dec 23, 2019', 'Dec 23, 2019', 'Dec 25, 2019', 'Feb 19, 2020', 'Feb 19, 2020']"

Without a doubt it is a good sedan, its just that the world is running away from sedans for the most part.

Tesla keeps referring to their waiting list, as the measure of desirability, but in fact, their reservations have taken a big hit. As more competition comes out with compelling vehicles, more and more of those reservations holders are going to jump to other vehicles. Starting with I-Pace, which the embargo on full test drive reviews is going to be lifted soon (possibly as early as Monday), which I expect we are going to see many favorable comparisons to Tesla vehicles. Jaguar is the first of many mainstream makers that are coming to the party, once people have the chance to see, touch, and drive these vehicles and directly compare them to Tesla, Tesla is in trouble. Musk talked about the pace of innovation in the last earnings call, I argue Tesla has now fallen way behind in innovation, and the S and X designs are becoming long in the tooth.

Lets assume the P and AWD take the same 20K to saturate, and 20K are going for the low priced model. At 5K per week, that is just 1 month of production for each config to saturate the USA market.

First I started looking at WEathertech. I know they are not cheap, but I had them in my previous sedan (Honda Accord) and I still have them in my other Truck (Chevy Silverado). I looked at the mats that I've got in my Checy and realized that even if I go with Tan WeatherTechs, they will just not look right in the Model 3 due to their design. I believe they will fit and keep moisture inside, but I don't think that's the look one should get if they get a Tesla.\nAnyways, I saw 3d maxpider mats online, they look nice in the pic, not that rugged, but I am concerned about 2 things, that's why decided to post here and ask your folks opinion. 1. This brand seems to be not too popular, or I am doing bad at my Google search. 2. I will have to wait when I order them. That's okay, unless I will really get a good product. And of course, I expect to get something, not just pay and keep getting run-around...\nI was looking at rubber mats, KAGU 3d mats. DO they fit well? How's the quality?

I declined as the traffic monitoring, weather, and internet access are superior on my existing iPhone and mobile hotspots.\n\nSo our other car, a BMW i3-REx, required buying an OBD interface and iPhone software, BimmerCode:\nenable REx at 75% SOC instead of automatic at 6% - this makes cross country driving practical. We turn on the REx and drive topping off the tank when reaching the last 1/4 tank, ~20 miles. When the electronic tank level limit is reached, the engine stops and we have the rest of the battery, ~50 miles, to reach a gas station.\nenable 2.3 gallon, tank level - the physical 2.8 gallon tank is software limited on how low it can go before the REx is turned off, originally 1.9 gallons. With the coding, I\'ve added 0.4 usable gallons, ~30 miles.\ndefault driving mode ""ECO PRO"" - the middle of three settings, it remaps the accelerator curve for a sedate driving style that increases EV and gas range. This avoids the inefficient, frantic accelerator behavior.\nadded tire temperature to tire pressure display - I\'m anal about running tires at maximum sidewall pressure and as close to perfect alignment to improve handling and tire life at a slightly harder ride. Seeing the temperature lets me know if there is a leak or just one side was in the sun or shade.\ndeclined to add AM radio audio - the AM traffic alerts still get through to the navigation system but there is no interesting AM content.\nPersonally, I think BMW was a prick for not making these settings optional in their ordinary software. So I had to buy the OBD and coding software.\n\nOne latent defect in our 2003 Prius was thermal mapping of the hybrid drivetrain. When the engine coolant reached a low temperature, the car forced the engine to run. So I used a TI-430 to spoof the coolant thermistor and allow engine off operation at lower coolant temperatures. Similar temperature flaws in the control laws were found in the 2017 Prius Prime that totally pissed me off.\n\nIMHO, Tesla upped the level not only with over-the-air updates but disabling fast DC charging in the car if Tesla decides it is a salvage.

But (yes there is a but in my previous statement..), in all fairness heated seats are optional item in many cars, especially at the lower price range. In many lower end models, if you want heated seats, you have to buy a package with that feature.\n\nTesla may have decided it is just cheaper to have put this feature in all cars, rather than have twenty variants that other manufacturers have. For example, other manufacturers have several trim levels (standard , XS, XL, turbo etc etc) and various packages (convenience, weather, technology, navigation etc etc). Only some variants (combinations of trim level and package) have heated seats. This adds to the price of the car as each variant needs to be specifically made and inventoried.\n\nTesla just has 2-3 of trim levels and all cars in that trim level have all features, but they can turned on and off with software. Clever if you ask. Car production is standardized but feature usage can be customized due to use of software. It is cheaper than having so many combinations of trim level and packages.\n\nThat said, they should have been upfront about these charges. I do not see it in the choices.

Is the rear wheel drive Standard a handful?\nI live in Dixie but January drove Huntsville AL, Dallas TX, Coffeyville KS, and home. If it looks like reaching the next SuperCharger is marginal, use PlugShare to find L2 chargers and take a meal/bathroom break. In an hour, you'll add 24-31 miles, usually enough. So my 204 mi leg Huntsville-to-Memphis involved an unplanned stop (25 mph head winds, 40F temp) in Corinth MS where we ate McDonalds while on the charger.\n\nWe subsequently found staying overnight in motels with free breakfasts and L2/Destination chargers was wise. We have even 'camped out at RV park' for half the motel price and leave the next day with 100% charge.\n\nClamps said: ↑\nReading the interior specifications the big differences seem to be heated rear seats, audio (specifically speakers), floor mats and premium connectivity duration for trial period. Is the audio dramatically different between the two? In regards to premium connectivity when it states satellite maps does that mean the gps system is a pay for service after trial period? How much does the premium connectivity cost after trial period?\nI can't answer about audio quality as I prefer podcasts or chatting with my wife. But we both grew up in the days of AM radio and I'm the youngest at 70 years of age. Our dogs have yet to complain about absence of rear seat heaters and the smallest enjoys my wife's lap.\n\nI declined the $10/month charge for premium connect since my iPhone and T-Mobile service fully meets my needs. I can set my cell phone as a mobile hotspot and use it on the road within cell service range. Of course your mileage may vary.

Of course, at higher speeds you\'ll lose some range. That\'s just basic physics, and unavoidable.\n\nDo be warned that in below freezing weather, the Model 3 takes a pretty severe hit to range, perhaps more so than most BEVs.

In the first year, you\'ll lose about 4-6 miles and bad weather, cold and headwinds, eats into the range. So what I did is:\nGunderland/Albany SuperChargers - maximum safe range with 30 mile reserve. So this trip plan works in nice and bad weather. There you charge just enough for the next segment.\nUtica plus 30 miles reserve and Syracuse plus 30 miles - the maximum and cheapest charge rate is when the SR+ (or any Tesla) has 5-10 miles remaining in the battery (this is EASY to achieve.) So in practice your time on a charger will be shortest and due to the pricing structure, cheapest.\nSyracuse, 1 hour charging - by now, the car has been on the road for over 5 hours and the humans need a break. I\'m recommending a 1 hour lunch/dinner while the car is on a charger. A time to refresh for the next leg.\nNiagra Falls - after getting through customs, take a biology break and quick charge to reach Toronto.\n\nClamps said: ↑\nIt\'s only 142 miles between Albany and Syracuse.

One other question, there is no wait time listed on the graph for the Guilderland charger, shouldn\'t there be at least another 1/2 hour added?\nYou asked about ""shorten the charge times"" and it means less total time sitting at chargers. Furthermore, it is cheaper because the two-tiered charge rate is very nice for fast DC charging.\n\nOne problem with PlugShare is it only allows 0.5 hr wait times: 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; . . . e.t.c. It really needs either 15 or 20 minute intervals to more accurately reflect practical Tesla charging. So when two stops are going to take a total of 30 minutes, ~15 minutes at each, one stop is shown as 0 hr and the other 30 minutes, 0.5 hr. It is a math trick that allows the total trip time to more accurately reflect the true time.\n\nClamps said: ↑\nIt sure makes the LR model more attractive for this type of road trip. We could even spend the night in Niagara Falls, which is something we like to do anyway.\nThe LR model supports a maximum of 250 kW vs 170 kW but at the expense of more kWh/mile. So that first segment after an overnight, full charge is nearly 5 hours ... and I\'m severely married. The more frequent stops of the SR+ also solves a \'biology break\' problem. <GRINS>\n\nIf you want to stay someplace overnight, use PlugShare to find affordable motels with free breakfasts and either free Tesla Distribution or free J1772 charging. You start the next day with maximum usable range and ready to go.

After seeing the difference between the standard and long-range RWD Model 3, we were very interested to see how much power loss would occur relative to battery state of charge with the massive amount of power the P3D makes.\n\nUnfortunately, we quickly found out that the car exceeds the limits of our dyno! The front pods of our dyno are able to absorb 2000Nm of torque, and this is just below what the front motor of the P3D puts out. After maxing out the dyno and getting the red screen of death a few times, I had to carefully ramp the power in at the start of the pull until the front motor went into field weakening, at which point it was possible to see the full power output.

When I have other people in my car we just have to laugh about it. It has been embarrassing to drive other people in my car, with the squeaking brakes and the extremely loud creaking like old bedsprings. I do wish I could just turn it in and get another car, but I simply cannot afford it. It took almost 3 weeks to get an appointment, which I have for tomorrow. And today I got a text telling me that they are not responsible for any noises if it isn’t covered under the warranty. So I will see what happens tomorrow. If it isn’t covered under the warranty, I will not have them work on it. And I will need some suggestions as to where else I could get it worked on.\nsqueaking brakes - if you drive backwards kinda fast and brake hard, what happens?\ncreaking - does it change if you drive in a tight left and then a right circle in a parking lot?\ncreaking - if you push down hard at each wheel, do you hear the creaking noise?\nFinding independent shops to look at a Tesla is a challenge. But I have a full set of tools; know where to get the Tesla tech manuals, and; treat a warranty as a 'speed bump.' I look forward to self-maintenance.\n\nLet me suggest these forums:\nhttps://teslaownersonline.com - a technologists forum with many skilled people (kinda like me.) They are anal about keeping things in the right thread but mostly to make it easier for us to find and follow-up.\nhttps://teslamotorsclub.com - they have a lot of folks to follow Tesla cars and news BUT they also have a few, undisciplined *ssholes. Then I realized they 'cut-and-paste' their expertise and aren't really interested in technical details. I rarely visit because the engineering data I crave is so thin. But they may have references to independent shops.\nI'm here primarily because of interest in charging technology.

But the ignorance about Tesla (and other EVs) is huge. So I periodically post to share facts and data. This happened yesterday:\n\n19.\nKit Gerhart Says:\nMarch 25th, 2020 at 7:44 pm\nFor the first time ever, I saw a Tesla on the interstate going faster, rather than slower than most of the traffic. It was a white Model 3. It turned off a couple miles after I saw it, so was likely driving locally, charged at home, with plenty of reserve range. The other Teslas I’ve seen on I-95 were among the slowest cars on the road, probably making sure they could safely make it to the next supercharger on a road trip.\n. . .\n22.\nBob Wilson Says:\nMarch 26th, 2020 at 1:44 am\n#19 – “a Tesla on the interstate going faster” is in part a function of unoptimized, trip planning software. With rare exception, the trip planning software expects fewer, longer, maximum charge sessions. In practice, the fastest trip times come from: (1) arrive with minimum charge, 5-10 miles, and (2) charge just enough to reach the next, fast DC charger.\n\nThe reason is the fastest Tesla charging occurs at the lowest state of charge. It rapidly reaches a peak and then trails down. Lots of high-speed, DC chargers shortens the charge stop time and speeds the block-to-block time. By happy accident, the charge rates also mean this is the least expensive cost per mile. It is the electric car version of a race car, pit stop.\n. . .\n24.\nBob Wilson Says:\nMarch 26th, 2020 at 5:25 am\n\n#19 – The web link is to a recent, Tesla benchmark chart. In just over 7 minutes, there was enough charge to reach Manchester TN. Round it up to 8 minutes, it would have cost $2.00 to drive 57 miles to Manchester TN. But I’d accidentally over charged while getting a bite of lunch.\n\nAdding gas is faster than charging but does not include biology breaks for food and restrooms. Unlike holding or monitoring the gas nozzle, charging is plug and forget. Regardless, EVs can be very affordable on the road.\n\nOne of the sad secrets is how many Tesla owners don't really know the highway costs. If we don't, traditional ICE/diesel owners are totally in the dark. We can solve that problem by just sharing the facts and data. No hyperbole, it is easily spotted and destroys one's credibility. Just share factual information, low keyed, and you've planted a seed for a future Tesla buyer.\n\nBob Wilson\n\nps.

Says:\nMarch 26th, 2020 at 8:19 am\nI have never noticed any Teslas going slower than the traffic. This is bizzarre. On the contrary, there used to be a ton of prius drivers who drove like they were in a funeral procession, obviously trying to hypermile. Fortunately this annoying visual has stopped maybe a decade ago. It was especially egregious when these JERKS were hypremiling on the LEFT Lane. These auto illiterates should try to do that in the Autobahn, where there are SERIOUS FINES if you use the left lane for ANYTHING BUT A PASSING LANE.\n\nTeslas are race cars in disguise, as Bob Wilson hinted. Get a grip. AND Tesla drivers are RARELY surprised about their remaining range, as we have seen in a ton of videos, they get ample warning AND they get full info on where they can find the next supercharger, which they would NEVER need to do on a weekday commuting, BTW. Their ranges are way too long for even the longest commutes.\n\n30.\nKit Gerhart Says:\nMarch 26th, 2020 at 8:34 am\n24 Thanks. Interesting.""]","['Mar 11, 2020', 'Mar 27, 2020']"
