1,"in the skies above hullavington airfield in south-west england, there was a time when trainee parachutists would leap out of aircraft into the void, trusting in the kit strapped to their backs to save them from falling to earth. the former raf base's current inhabitant, dyson, is embarking on its own adventure fraught with peril: a ¬£2bn project to develop and build electric cars from scratch. the uk company is betting on its ingenuity, engineering skills and technology to save it from falling to earth in its audacious attempt to break into the global automotive industry. ""a car's a huge challenge,"" founder james dyson told the financial times at the company's nearby malmesbury headquarters. the ¬£2bn gamble is the appliance maker's boldest move yet; one that will either grow to define the brand as it dwarfs its other products that range from vacuum cleaners to hair dryers, or drain its resources and potentially plunge it into oblivion. through interviews with more than 20 people, the ft has gleaned details about the project's scope and current status, including learning that dyson is considering excluding its world-leading ""solid state"" battery technology from its debut model. dyson declined to confirm many of the details in this report. the company is initially planning a range of three vehicles, according to two people. the first car will be used to establish a route to market, a supply chain and a potential customer base. because of this, the vehicle will have a relatively low production run ‚Äî in the single-digit thousands, three people said. the second and third vehicles, released later, will aim to be substantially higher volume. ""even with a low-volume vehicle, they can make a business case and they will learn a tremendous amount about how to build a vehicle,"" says philippe houchois, an automotive analyst at jefferies investment bank. dyson has worked extensively on lightweight materials, leading several people to speculate the first vehicle may be substantially comprised of plastics rather than metals, something usually reserved for high-end supercars. this would make the cars lighter ‚Äî important because of the weight of electric batteries ‚Äî but also allowing for more inventive designs. when announcing the project last september, sir james said the first car would look ""quite different"" to any currently on the market. crucially, dyson is considering using lithium ion batteries rather than solid state in the first car, according to three people. although the company has not confirmed a decision, a choice not to use solid state would indicate a scaling back in the technical ambitions for its first vehicle. the aim is to use solid state in the two future models, one person with sight of the plans said. solid state batteries, which dyson has been developing for years, are a step change beyond lithium ion technology, with the ability to drive further and charge faster. sylvain gaboury | filmmagic | getty images sir james dyson with one of his dyson inventions. while many major car manufacturers are developing the technology, only toyota has laid out a timeline to release a solid state car before 2025. that means dyson has the potential to be first to market with a technology widely hailed as the future of electric cars. but ditching solid state in the first model would give dyson a better chance of hitting its target of getting the vehicle to market by 2021, says mr houchois at jefferies. ""they want to control the variables. what they don't want to be is a tesla that over-promises and then delivers two to three years late."" sir james told the ft the company has been ""investing heavily in new battery technology, solid state battery technology‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâbut those sorts of technologies can take some time to get there."" but the entrepreneur declined to give specific details of its battery plans, or confirm ft reports about the decision. ""we're not talking about what we're doing,"" he says. the company has pledged to invest ¬£1bn into its battery development, and another ¬£1bn into the car venture itself. sir james remains confident it will hit its target of releasing a car in 2020 or 2021. yet the timeline is extremely ambitious, especially since the key decision over a manufacturing site has yet to be made. the uk remains in serious contention for a manufacturing location, sir james insists, along with singapore, malaysia and china. it is thought two uk sites are being considered, one in wales and one in wiltshire, according to discussions with local agencies and people familiar with dyson's plans. however, several factors point against deciding to locate in britain. despite asking for financial support from the uk government, conversations with officials have failed to yield more funding on top of a ¬£16m grant dyson received for its battery development. sir james expects china to be the company's largest market for its cars ‚Äî something that would by implication favour one of the far eastern nations where dyson currently has manufacturing operations, such as singapore or malaysia. the availability of local skills in electronics and battery technology are also a major factor, he said. ""you've got to do it where it's commercially the best place to do it,"" he says, adding the final manufacturing decision will be taken before the summer. singapore, where dyson has manufacturing capacity, is thought to be favoured by the business, according to multiple people. the group has also been heavily recruiting potential sales staff in china, according to two people in the country. read more from financial times: dyson should never say never in quest for electric dream  musk's mega-bucks don't require mega profits  musk reaches for the stars but investors grow impatient  but with that crucial piece in the puzzle still missing, some in the industry doubt whether the company can have its cars, and its suppliers, ready in time. ""whether you're a dyson or a toyota it takes 18 months to tool for headlights,"" says one person who has worked with dyson on its project, while selecting suppliers can also take up to two years. dyson aims to lean less heavily on suppliers than traditional carmakers, partly because of a penchant for making components in house, and partly because electric cars contain substantially fewer bits than their combustion engine counterparts. the group already produces electric motors, which turn the wheels, as well as battery cells in-house, and is investing heavily in software development, an increasingly important part of modern cars. in the past six months, dyson has held extensive talks with some of the industry's largest suppliers. in some of the meetings the company was vague or unclear about what it was specifically after, according to several people who took part in discussions. ""they have tended to keep all the of the right people in house,"" says one person who has advised the group. ""but that approach doesn't work in autos, where more of the work is outsourced."" even so, as a maker of domestic appliances, dyson does have long experience of running a global supply chain and manufacturing operations ‚Äî something that has caused significant problems for fresh industry entrants such as tesla. ""he's not a silicon valley start-up, he understands manufacturing,"" says one long-time supplier to the company. current suppliers, while fiercely loyal, also warn against underestimating the company. ""i get the feeling that he's much more advanced than we're led to believe,"" says one supplier, who has been involved in the automotive project. ""he's either completely misaligned himself, or he's better organised than anyone in the market expects."""

But unlike Tesla, and most (or all) of the other survey rating organizations, they are the most independent, and do not have the subject manufacturers as clients or sponsors. So their ratings carry far more weight than most others.But as I said earlier, I also like the residual value surveys, because they are betting on actual future values.

0,"(adds police statement) washington, may 16 (reuters) - the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) said on wednesday that it was sending a team to investigate the crash of a tesla inc vehicle last week in utah that occurred while the car was in autopilot mode. it is at least the second tesla crash linked to the semi-autonomous autopilot system being investigated by the government agency since january. police in utah said a tesla report of the vehicle showed that the driver of the model s enabled autopilot about 1 minute and 22 seconds before the crash. the report said she took her hands off the steering wheel ""within two seconds"" of engaging the system and then did not touch the steering wheel for the next 80 seconds, until the crash happened. the police said in a statement that the driver, a 28-year-old woman, ""admitted that she was looking at her phone prior to the collision."" tesla advises drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using autopilot, which the company says does not make the vehicle autonomous. the nhtsa said it ""launched its special crash investigations team to gather information on the south jordan, utah, crash,"" and said it ""will take appropriate action based on its review."" tesla did not immediately comment. the police said the tesla model s during that day's trip registered more than a dozen instances of the driver's hands being off the steering wheel. on two such occasions, the driver had her hands off the wheel for more than one minute each time and her hands came back on only after a visual alert, the tesla report said. the driver was traveling at 60 miles (97 km) per hour when the model s smashed into a fire truck stopped at a red light about 20 miles south of salt lake city on friday night, according to police. the tesla driver suffered a broken ankle. police issued the driver a traffic citation for failure to keep proper lookout. nhtsa is also investigating a fatal crash in march that involved a tesla model x using autopilot. it is also probing the january crash of a tesla vehicle apparently traveling in autopilot that struck a fire truck. both incidents were in california. last week, nhtsa also said it would probe a may 8 tesla accident in florida that killed two teenagers and injured another. autopilot was not thought to play a part. nhtsa can order a recall if it finds a defect poses an unreasonable risk to safety. the national transportation safety board, a separate government agency that looks into accidents and makes safety recommendations, has said it is not investigating the utah crash. the ntsb is investigating the other three tesla incidents being looked at by nhtsa, as well as an august 2017 tesla battery fire in california, in which an owner ran the vehicle into his garage. swiss prosecutors said this week that they were looking into the fatal crash of a tesla in southern switzerland.

0,"46 pm / updated 15 minutes ago daimler warns of supply chain risk from switch to electric cars reuters staff 4 min read frankfurt (reuters) - daimler ag ( daign.de ), owner of the mercedes-benz brand, warned that a fall in demand for diesel cars and a switch to electric vehicles could force it to prop up its supplier base. carmakers face increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over pollution levels produced by their diesel-engined vehicles after volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) in 2015 admitted to cheating emission tests using engine management software. to avoid a total ban on their diesel vehicles, daimler and other carmakers have stepped up development of electric cars and agreed to update their engine management software to cut down pollution levels. daimler‚Äôs suppliers are being forced to invest to help electrify the entire mercedes-benz range by 2022, prompting the carmaker to use unusually frank language to warn about the impact of the shift to electrified cars in its report. ‚Äúdue to the planned electrification of new model series and a shift in customer demand from diesel to gasoline engines, the mercedes-benz cars segment in particular is faced with the risk that daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers,‚Äù the carmaker said in its annual report. ‚Äúthis could result in over- or under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers. if suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,‚Äù daimler said. ‚Äúnecessary capacity expansion at suppliers‚Äô plants could also require cost-effective participation,‚Äù daimler added. daimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing daimler to step in. daimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. in its annual report, daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices. ‚Äúgenerally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,‚Äù the annual report said. daimler‚Äôs report, published on tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros (12.46 billion pounds) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier. the stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings. daimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined mercedes-benz vehicles in the united states in a class-action suit which alleges the german carmaker used software to reduce emissions. daimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed. among the legal risks faced by daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities. daimler also said in its report that chief executive dieter zetsche‚Äôs total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier. reporting by edward taylor; editing by keith weir"
1,"bmw and daimler are merging their untraditional operations‚Äîeverything from car-sharing and ride-hailing to parking locator services and electric vehicle charging‚Äîinto a single joint business as the two rival automakers attempt to better compete with uber, lyft, and other mobility companies. the two companies on wednesday signed an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture that will include five verticals: car-sharing, ride-hailing, parking, electric vehicle charging, and what they describe as ‚Äúmultimodal,‚Äù a term meant to cover the on-demand ordering and payment component of the business. bmw and daimler ag, the owner of mercedes-benz, said they will continue to compete in their core business of building and selling vehicles. ‚Äúpeople will look back on today as a historic moment for the mobility of the future,‚Äù bmw group board member peter schwarzenbauer said during a roundtable discussion with reporters at the new york international auto show. ‚Äútwo of the major players in the automotive industry are basically joining forces in building a new company, which will in my eyes, offer a level of service that is unheard of yet.‚Äù the idea is to create a single digital ecosystem that customers can use to hail a taxi, rent a car for short stints, or find and pay for parking. the two companies will not merge their respective autonomous vehicle development programs. ‚Äúthe target isn‚Äôt to do a little bit here and a little bit there,‚Äù schwarzenbauer said. ‚Äúwe want to become the leading provider when it comes to mobility services.‚Äù but before that can happen, the two companies will have to go through the complicated process of merging their operations and determine whether to rebrand existing businesses such as daimler‚Äôs car2go and bmw‚Äôs drivenow and reachnow car-sharing units or to leave those names intact. the deal also has to be reviewed and approved by antitrust regulators. the number of businesses currently operating under each company illustrate the complexity of this new enterprise, and hint at how long it might take bmw and daimler to integrate them. for example, bmw‚Äôs drivenow and daimler‚Äôs car2go have 20,000 vehicles spread out among 31 cities globally. other bmw or daimler-owned mobility operations include moovel, reachnow, ride-hailing services such as mytaxi, chauffeur priv√©, clever taxi and beat, and parking businesses parknow and parkmobile. some 13 million customers and 140,000 drivers are already using bmw‚Äôs and daimler‚Äôs ride-hailing services. bmw and daimler are also projecting that the deal will increase profits. if the merger is approved, daimler expects earnings before taxes for its financial services unit will be ‚Äúsignificantly higher than the previous year.‚Äù bmw said the joint venture will trigger a one-time valuation and earnings effect in its group financial statement. pre-tax earnings would increase slightly in 2018 compared with the previous year, bmw said. the companies have gone into business together before. in 2015, a coalition of german carmakers that included daimler, audi, and bmw agreed to acquire nokia‚Äôs here and its mapping technology."

0,"london (reuters) - when electric carmaker tesla inc. launched its first mass market model last summer, it sent a shockwave through the aluminum industry by largely shifting to steel and away from the lighter weight metal it had used in its first two luxury models. file photo: a tesla model 3 is seen in a showroom in los angeles, california, u.s. january 12, 2018. reuters/lucy nicholson/file photo the switch by elon musk‚Äôs tesla to the heavier-but-cheaper metal highlights how steel is fighting back against aluminum, which had widely been expected to be the bigger beneficiary of the electric vehicle revolution. aluminum had been seen as the key to offsetting the weight of batteries in order to extend the range of electric vehicles, crucial to increased consumer acceptance. but as makers of battery-powered cars look to tap into bigger markets with cheaper vehicles - and embrace technological developments in batteries and components - many are increasingly looking to steel to cut costs. the price of tesla‚Äôs mass-market orientated model 3 is around half of the ¬£70,000 luxury model s. ‚Äúbefore the aim was ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get the [electric vehicles] developed‚Äô, now it‚Äôs ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get them developed at the right price point,‚Äô‚Äù says mauro erriquez, a partner at mckinsey & company in germany who specializes in the auto sector. it is the latest tussle in a decades-long battle between steel and aluminum for market share among automakers, seeking to cut the weight of vehicles to help slash emissions and meet tough government pollution standards. steel is also winning back some market share among gasoline vehicles, such as the audi a8. the latest model abandoned its heavy use of aluminum and shifted to a mix of steel, aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber. the competition between the metals has intensified amid rapidly growing demand for battery-powered cars. sales of electric and hybrid vehicles are due to surge to 30 percent of the global auto market by 2030, according to metal consultants cru, up from 4 percent of the 86 million vehicles sold last year. in china, the world‚Äôs largest auto market, sales of new energy vehicles are due to grow by 40 percent this year to top 1 million vehicles, according to the china association of automobile manufacturers. tesla declined to comment, but in a filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission last month it said it designed the model 3 ‚Äúwith a mix of materials to be lightweight and safe while also increasing cost-effectiveness for this mass-market vehicle‚Äù. other makers of mass market electric vehicles that have also chosen steel over aluminum include nissan motor co ltd‚Äôs ( 7201.t ) leaf, the world‚Äôs best-selling all-electric vehicle, and volkswagen‚Äôs ( vowg_p.de ) e-golf. the e-golf has 129 kg of aluminum and the leaf uses 171 kg while tesla‚Äôs luxury model s contains 661 kg of the metal, according to a2mac1 automotive benchmarking. a detailed breakdown was not available for the tesla 3. (for a graphic of metals used in vehicles click tmsnrt.rs/2g9ouvq ) step change aluminum is still expected to benefit greatly from the electric vehicle revolution, however, especially from hybrids because they have two engines. both the combustion engine block and transmission are typically made of aluminum while the metal is also often used for housing the battery and motor in electric vehicles, according to auto metals specialist alumag in germany. and, because it is expected to be years before pure electric vehicles become widely used - in part due to the lack of power charging networks - the growth of hybrids in the interim is expected to benefit aluminum. according to cru consultant eoin dinsmore, demand for aluminum from electric and hybrid vehicles is forecast to increase ten times to nearly 10 million tonnes by 2030. aluminum was used in the first electric london black cab, which launched last year, spurring the reopening of a uk aluminum plant in wales owned by norway‚Äôs aluminum producer norsk hydro nyh.ol. slideshow (9 images) ‚Äúwe chose aluminum as a material as it is nearly three times lighter than steel in its raw form, and it absorbs twice as much energy in a crash,‚Äù said chris staunton, chief engineer of body structures for the firm that developed the taxi for the london electric vehicle company ( 0175.hk ). both staunton‚Äôs firm and the london electric vehicle company are owned by china‚Äôs geely automotive holdings ltd 0175.hk>. (graphic: aluminum content climbs in vehicles - reut.rs/2fihfll ) better batteries but aluminum remains more expensive than steel. benchmark aluminum futures cmal3 on the london metal exchange are around $2,050 per ton, more than three times the cost of lme steel rebar srrc1 at $585 a ton. the price gap between the types of aluminum and steel used in autos was not as wide, but still represented significant savings by using steel, industry experts said. meanwhile, stronger and cheaper batteries for electric vehicles as well as developments in the components that generate power and overall structural design have lessened the need for aluminum to cut weight to extend the range. since 2010, the cost of batteries have tumbled to as low as $114 per kilowatt hour from $1,000/kwh and are expected to drop further in coming years, according to alumag. ‚Äúi think car makers are finding that as battery costs fall they can achieve their range requirement with an all-steel solution,‚Äù said george coates, technical director for worldautosteel, the automotive arm of the world steel association. improvements in the powertrain - the main components in a car that generate power - have also had a big impact. the 2017 model of the nissan leaf extended its range by nearly 50 percent to 172 km compared to the 2011 version mainly by improving the powertrain, consolidating four separate systems into one, said mckinsey‚Äôs erriquez. (for a graphic on aluminum vs steel prices click reut.rs/2is9obr ) material mix at the same time, the steel industry has developed advanced high strength steel products, which are stronger and lighter than normal steel, and importantly, cheaper than aluminum. ‚Äú(steel) companies like thyssenkrupp ( tkag.de ) and arcelormittal ( mt.as ), they‚Äôre not going to just give up this market share. there will be a battle for the material,‚Äù said jost gaertner, partner at alumag. future models will likely contain a complex mix of materials, including various grades of steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, magnesium and plastics, automakers and consultants said. bmw, which used large amounts of costly aluminum and carbon fiber in its i3 and i8, told reuters it was not planning to increase the use of those materials in future electric models. ‚Äúthere is no ‚Äòone material fits all‚Äô solution‚Äù for future electric vehicles, the german carmaker said in an email. ‚Äúwe will continue to employ each material in a way and in a quantity which brings in its specific advantages.‚Äù reporting by eric onstad; editing by veronica brown and cassell bryan-low"
