0,"new york, march 28 (reuters) - tesla inc shares fell more than 9 percent on wednesday following a downgrade by moody’s investors service, a probe by the national transportation safety board of a recent fatal crash and concerns about model 3 production. the sell-off came after tesla tumbled 8.2 percent on tuesday, the lowest close in almost a year. tesla was trading on wednesday at $258.44, down $20.74 a share, off a low of $252.10. late on tuesday, moody’s investors service downgraded tesla’s credit rating to b3 from b2. moody’s said the ratings “reflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company’s model 3 electric vehicle.” it also “faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds.” tesla has $230 million in convertible bonds maturing in november 2018 and $920 million in march 2019. moody’s said its negative outlook for tesla “reflects the likelihood that tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.” moody’s said tesla is targeting weekly production of 2,500 model 3 vehicles by the end of march, and 5,000 per week by the end of june, down from the company’s year-earlier production expectations of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017 and 10,000 by the end of 2018. tesla declined to comment on the downgrade. the company plans to provide an update on model 3 production next week. in last week’s accident, it was unclear if tesla’s automated control system was driving the car. the accident involved two other cars, the ntsb and police said. tesla vehicles have a system called autopilot that handles some driving tasks. the 38-year-old driver of the tesla died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash. late tuesday, tesla said in a blog post it does “not yet know what happened in the moments leading up to the crash,” but added that data shows tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with autopilot engaged “roughly 85,000 times... and there has never been an accident that we know of.” the company statement did not say if the crashed vehicle had been in autopilot mode.

Our model now suggests that Tesla will come in at the high end of its forecast for quarterly production of 50,000-55,000 Model 3s""I need to take back my comment about Tom Randall's model. He is trying his best to decipher the devious tricks that Elon plays on him. So it is really not Tom Randall's fault that Elon is using his fan journalists to push false narratives to the market.I read the explanation Tom posted, and I think it's good he fine tuned his model to ""mind the gaps"". The issue is, he also disclosed it, so Elon will now go and fix his own algo of VIN assignment etc. to keep deceiving Tom's model.Elon is the ultimate mastermind in these kind of games. And then, he will ask analysts to to go look at Bloomberg model for production numbers instead of disclosing such simple numbers.. Of course, he always knew that the model was grossly wrong all the time. But that never stopped him to ask people to use that model.Tom has also added this disclaimer now (but who really reads all these? I didn't ).We still caution readers not to place too much emphasis on our weekly estimates. For example, our model shows weekly production in a sharp downward trend for September. Upon close inspection of the two datasets, it seems likely that our model overestimated production in August, when Tesla registered an unprecedented number of VINs, and is now underestimating production while Tesla works through its backlog.Gee, I wish he said ""readers and writers"", so it would have covered the IEV writers also, who often write up rosy articles based solely on that unreliable number. Is it a coincidence that Elon now follows IEV instead of Electrek?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"berlin (reuters) - volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) said profitability could take a hit this year as the carmaker invests billions of euros in electric vehicles (evs) and launches a raft of new models. europe’s largest automotive group, which reported record 2017 earnings on friday, said it expected a return on sales for 2018 of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent before special items, after reaching 7.4 percent last year. it expects revenue to exceed the 2017 record of 231 billion euros ($284.13 billion) by as much as 5 percent. volkswagen (vw) is investing billions of euros into electric and self-driving cars while still paying out for the “dieselgate” emissions scandal which has cost the company around $30 billion in charges and fines. the german group set aside another 600 million euros in the fourth quarter in provisions for higher legal risks and vehicle buy-backs related to the emissions scandal, raising 2017 provisions to 3.2 billion euros. in total, vw has now put aside 25.8 billion euros to cover fines, compensation and vehicle refits, of which nearly 20 billion have so far been paid out. the wolfsburg-based carmaker is known for taking a conservative stance when it comes to its outlook for profitability, but analysts were still disappointed. “there is room for them to go higher,” said bankhaus metzler analyst juergen pieper who has a “buy” recommendation on vw shares. “the market probably needs to scale back its expectations a bit.” vw shares fell after the results and closed 0.8 percent lower at 162.60 euros. vw had been a laggard on electrification until it admitted in 2015 to cheating on u.s. diesel emissions tests and had to deal with new chinese quotas for evs and tightening regulation in europe. this prompted a strategic shift to zero-emission and self-driving technology, and vw has one of the most ambitious programs in the industry. “we must not relax our efforts because huge challenges lie ahead,” finance chief frank witter said. “shaping the group’s transformation will not only require a great deal of time and energy, it will also be very expensive.” group operating profit after special items nearly doubled to a record 13.8 billion euros from 7.1 billion a year ago, vw said, helped by record sales of luxury audis and porsches but below the bottom-end forecast of 13.9 billion in a reuters poll. vw said earnings were driven by a growing share of sales of higher-margin models such as the redesigned tiguan suv and the arteon fastback and increasing savings from vw’s modular platforms. the carmaker forecast 2018 group sales to exceed moderately last year’s record of 10.7 million vehicles. group sales jumped 10 percent in january with demand up in all major world regions, showing that the emissions scandal has not dented vw’s popularity among consumers. the company faced a new diesel scandal last month when it emerged that vw and other german carmakers had sponsored diesel fume tests involving monkeys and humans. vw’s supervisory board on friday also discussed steps to prevent such research experiments from happening again, a source at the carmaker said, as it is seeking to become more accountable after “dieselgate.” separately, management and the supervisory board on friday proposed to raise the dividend for 2017 to 3.90 euros per common share and to 3.96 euros per preference share, from 2.00 euros and 2.06 euros respectively for the previous.

0,"may 24, 2018 / 2:35 pm / updated 21 hours ago commentary: what are ""critical"" minerals and what is the us going to do about them? andy home 7 min read london (reuters) - niocorp developments, which is in the process of raising financing for a minerals project in nebraska, has just seen its toronto-listed shares surge from c$0.52 to $0.70 in the space of two days thanks to the u.s. government. file photo: an employee works with a titanium ingot at the vsmpo-avisma factory in verkhnyaya-salda, some 1,800 km east of moscow. reuters/svetlana burmistrova niocorp’s planned mine and processing facility at elk creek will produce three metals - scandium, niobium and titanium - that have all been officially designated “critical” minerals by the interior department. no-one’s mined niobium in the united states since 1959, according to the united states geological survey (usgs). the country relies exclusively on imports, mostly from brazil. the same is true of scandium, a metal which, according to niocorp, has been used for several decades in “cutting-edge soviet and russian military technologies” but not by the u.s. armed forces due to a lack of supply. this is precisely the point for u.s. president donald trump’s administration, which is developing a strategy to reduce import reliance for metals considered “critical to the economic and national security of the united states.” what’s critical? the department of the interior has identified 35 minerals as “critical”. the designation is based on a matrix of criteria, including physical scarcity, concentration of production, supply chain reliability and u.s. import dependency. or, as summarized by one commerce department representative, “critical means you need it, strategic means you don’t have it.” the unnamed official, quoted by the usgs in its explanation of the methodology behind the list, was involved with the 1978-1979 presidential review of nonfuel minerals policy. which is a reminder that this is not the first u.s. administration that has been worried about mineral import dependence. however, the list of minerals deemed “critical” has changed significantly over the intervening 40 years as manufacturing processes have advanced. consider, for example, the case of the humble computer chip. in the 1980s, according to the usgs, only 12 elements were used in its manufacture. a decade later and the number had risen to 16 and by 2006 as many as 60 elements were being used for high-speed, high-capacity integrated circuits. whole new industries have emerged over the same time frame. the lithium ion battery, which sits at the heart of the green transport revolution, was only commercialised at the start of the 1990s. no big surprise, then, to see both lithium and cobalt, two key but supply-challenged inputs into the new generation of batteries, appear on the list. so too does the rare earth elements group. none of them are domestically produced in the u.s. and most of them come from just one country, china. china is also the dominant supplier of other esoteric but “critical” components of the elemental table such as antimony, indium, tellurium and tungsten. the list includes more conventional commodities such as the platinum group metals (all of them), tin and aluminium. the usgs stresses that in such cases it’s not just the metal but the entire supply chain that is problematic. “aluminum is included to represent the aluminum supply chain because the united states is 100 percent reliant on imports of metallurgical grade bauxite, and some forms of high purity alumina and aluminum metal used for important applications also are considered critical.” the full list of critical minerals can be found here: here reducing import reliance the u.s. government is imposing tariffs on imports of aluminium with the stated aim of rekindling dormant domestic production capacity and reducing import dependency. and increasing domestic supply across the spectrum of the periodic table is going to be a core recommendation in the report being compiled by the commerce department for submission to president trump by aug. 16, 2018. commerce is also likely to recommend improved mapping of resources, streamlining lease permitting and anything else that will “increase discovery, production and domestic refining of critical minerals.” one possible outcome, welcomed by companies such as niocorp but feared by environmental groups, could be a revitalization of the u.s. mining industry. as the commerce department itself notes, “any recommendations to improve permitting processes for critical minerals will improve permitting processes for all minerals administered under the same laws and regulations by the bureau of land management and other federal land management agencies.” however, it’s going to be a slow process. niocorp, for example, is the only prospective near-term project for niobium and scandium in north america and, even with a full feasibility study already completed, the company still needs to raise around $1 billion to realise its ambitions. which is why the commerce department report will also look at other sources of supply such as recycling and cooperating with “allies and partners” to access targeted minerals. defense logistics agency the commerce department’s list of potential measures doesn’t include the creation of a national stockpile of critical minerals such as that operated in china by the state-run strategic reserves bureau. that’s because the united states already has one, operated by the defense logistics agency (dla), the body charged with managing supply chains for the country’s armed forces. as of september 2016, the most recent operational report, the dla held stocks of many of the minerals on the interior department’s list with a total value of $1.15 billion. on the current financial year’s potential shopping list are rare earths (up to a maximum 416 tonnes), battery precursors such as lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (2.16 tonnes), ferroniobium (209 tonnes) and truly esoteric goodies such as cadmium zinc tellurium and tungsten rhenium. catching up the dla is also heavily involved both in recycling materials such as germanium and studying possible alternatives to existing “critical” military inputs. but it can only be part of a broader strategy that will have to be both multidimensional and highly flexible. there is no simple solution to the fact that the united states doesn’t have any commercially exploitable bauxite deposits or that cobalt production is so concentrated on the african copperbelt. moreover, other countries, particularly china, have already aggressively built out supply chains to supply the battery-makers that will power the world’s growing electric vehicle fleet. identifying which minerals are “critical” is the easy part. working out what to do about them is going to be much harder. the opinions expressed here are those of the

1,"Domenick said: ↑I just mentioned in another thread about how Munro praised the body of the Bolt (close to where they mention FEA), so, as you say, it does seem like they use it in that particular body structure (and most likely every other body structure as well).I really wish a reporter familiar with these sorts of design and manufacturing systems could get access to Tesla, so we could get more into the nitty gritty of everything. I mean, it's cool that they brought CBS Morning News into the plant, but more industry specific reportage would be nice.Tesla is pretty secretive about their design and manufacturing process, but on the Model S it was a MI company that did the chassis engineering, I am not sure on the Model 3, because nobody has taken credit for it publicly, but when you look at the upper A arm Munro had on the teardown, that is obviously not a part that has been optimized using FEA. I am excited to see Munro next time on Autoline After Hours for a follow up when they have completed the job, should be end of May or early June.Yes, the Bolt body structure is outstanding, as can be seen in the crash test results, and also real world crashes, I saw pictures of one head on that looked terrible, but the passenger compartment was mostly intact and the battery did not catch fire. I think a car that shows more the direction GM is going in structural design though is the Cadillac CT6. That car is really a masterpiece of optimized design, and mass efficiency, when GM applies this same skill to the next generation EV, I think we are going to have something special.When I looked at the cutaway on the jaguar I-Pace it is obvious on many components that FEA was involved in the design. but with an all riveted/bonded aluminum structure it will be interesting to see how it holds up long term. If you get a chance check out this video from 13:00, its some amazing testing...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"(adds details of crash, prior ntsb probes) march 27 (reuters) - the u.s. national transportation safety board is opening a field investigation of a fatal tesla inc crash and major vehicle fire near mountain view, california, last week, the agency said in a statement on tuesday. it was unclear if the car was being driven by its automated control system at the time of the accident, which killed the tesla driver and involved two other cars, the ntsb said in a twitter post. tesla vehicles have a system called autopilot that handles some driving tasks at times. tesla did not immediately comment. the california highway patrol said the electric-powered tesla model x crashed into a freeway divider on friday and then was hit by a mazda before colliding with an audi. the tesla's lithium batteries caught fire and emergency officials consulted tesla engineers advice before determining it was safe to move the vehicle and how to extinguish the battery fire. ntsb said the issues being examined include the post-crash fire and removing it from the scene. in january, the ntsb and u.s. national highway traffic safety administration sent investigators to california to investigate the crash of a fire truck and a tesla that apparently was traveling in semi-autonomous mode. the ntsb can make safety recommendations but only nhtsa can order automakers to recall unsafe vehicles or fine automakers if they fail to remedy safety defects in a timely fashion. before the agency could demand a recall from tesla, it must open a formal investigation, a step it has not yet taken. tesla's autopilot allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods. tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel ""at all times"" before they can use autopilot. the ntsb faulted tesla in a prior fatal autopilot crash. in september, ntsb chairman robert sumwalt said operational limitations in the tesla model s played a major role in a may 2016 crash in florida that killed a driver using autopilot. that crash raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention but cannot completely replace human drivers. tesla in september 2016 unveiled improvements to autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving.

0,"For thread consistency:Source: https://insideevs.com/news/349982/nhtsa-tesla-autopilot-model-3-death-video/Preliminary findings indicate the Autopilot system was indeed on at the time of the fatal crash involving a Model 3. The accident occurred in Delray Beach, Florida back on March 1, 2019. . . .Missing from the article is the firmware versions and updates:March 1 - fatal accident occurs, Version ??March 26 - I took delivery of my Model 3 Standard Range Plus, Version 5.15April 4 - first references to Model 3, Version 8.5, in Tesla Motors Club forumLate thought, this is the second semi-trailer crash in about 3 years. It is hard to claim this is a pattern but then the Boeing 737-MAX only had two crashes before the fleet was grounded. I am pointing out that the version of software is a problem the analysts will have to work out.. . . The posted speed limit is 55 mph.Preliminary data from the vehicle show that the Tesla’s Autopilot system—an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that provides both longitudinal and lateral control over vehicle motion—was active at the time of the crash.1 The driver engaged the Autopilot about 10 seconds before the collision. From less than 8 seconds before the crash to the time of impact, the vehicle did not detect the driver’s hands on the steering wheel. Preliminary vehicle data show that the Tesla was traveling about 68 mph when it struck the semitrailer. Neither the preliminary data nor the videos indicate that the driver or the ADAS executed evasive maneuvers.One clue is setting dynamic cruise control. The current version 8.5 by default sets the cruise control speed to the posted speed limit. This speed can be adjusted by operating the cruise control trim wheel apart from entering auto steer. Dynamic cruise control speed can be set before entering AutoPilot self-steering but I have seen where the car will initially limit the cruise control speed. We need to know more details about the timing of these two.We also need to understand why the trailer did not trigger emergency stopping. My experience is the optical systems are short-range, ~30 m. The radar is the long range sensor but the following distance can vary from 1-8 (my experience.) Following trailers has been no problem but side-on was common to both fatal accidents.Bob Wilson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"JJ2 hey just add features, and raise the price. We were told the base price was $39,900.But on the invoice, It's $35,400. And another $4500 for 'Standard Range Plus Rear-Wheel Drive'. More Tesla BS! Aggrivating. They should be better than that, but I guess they have their reasons.The $35,000 base price Model 3 was available for a limited time, but (a) now it's available only as an ""off-menu"" order at a store or by phone. If you were told by a Tesla rep that the ""base price"" was $39,900, then the rep lied to you. (b) As I understand it, Tesla quite recently raised the prices slightly across the board -- some are saying that's in response to Trump's tariffs -- and the base price is now $35,400.Now, that doesn't include delivery fee, which as I understand it is $1200... but the MSRP quoted by other auto makers includes neither delivery nor dealer prep fees. At least Tesla includes prep charges in the delivery fee.However, what you got wasn't a base Standard Range Model 3, but rather a ""Standard Range Plus""; thus the $4500 upcharge. Not sure why you're calling that ""Tesla BS""... you really did get a better car than the base ""Standard Range"" Model 3, even if that wasn't your intent.But you do have an option! Tesla is offering a 7-day return policy. If you really think you've been jerked around, then tell them you want to return the car, and trade it for the off-menu base $35,400 Model 3. Well, if you want red paint, then there's an extra charge for that, so you still won't be getting the absolute lowest possible price on a Model 3.Anyway, whatever you decide, I hope you have many years of happy driving with your Model 3!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"d Green said: ↑Domenick, come on man... You really think Tesla is going to reach 35K model 3 deliveries next month? That is production well over 1000 units a day? Tesla struggled and strained to hit 500 on one day a week and a half ago. That 500 was not sustained the following day going into the shutdown. I expect you to put just a bit more thought into your post, and post things that actually make sense. Elon said in the letter on April 16.""By having a Model 3 subsystem burst-build requirement of 6k by the end of June, we will lay the groundwork for achieving a steady 6k/week across the whole Model 3 system a few months later.""When I read this I get that the goal is by June 30 to have each subsystem burst to a rate of 6K per week, so that the entire production can get there on 9-30-2018? So Elon's goal for Tesla is 6K our week by 9-30-2018, and for the record how does Tesla typically do in reaching Elon's goals? Just FYI 6K our week is not even close to 1K+ per day sustained. And 9-30-2018 is not July... So your message is not the bull case, its the fairy tale case. I am not being a negative Nellie, I am just going with the facts and messages that have been made public. Elon has stated publicly that Tesla goal is sustained 5K per week at the end of Q2, which is + or - 21.4K per month, or 714 a day... Show me the math that gets Tesla to 35K produced, and or delivered any month this year??Click to expand...I know you aren't being a ""negative Nellie,"" and that this is your honest assessment, and I certainly know the scenario I outlined is (probably too) optimistic since the company is often behind/short on its targets. I pulled up March figures this morning, the first link I saw, and Camry was at 24,xxx, while its competitors were lower. Just now I've checked May's numbers and they are higher (Camry did 29,848 in May).So, I don't see Model 3 hitting 35k a month for a while -- probably not this year. If it can get up to 21.4K, that's certainly approaching the neighbourhood of the top selling sedans.They'll get production there eventually. I think the bigger challenge may be sustaining that sort of demand once it does. It's a declining segment overall, and I think the Kona, and any number of other electric crossovers are going to eat into its market share. Though, then again, it remains to be seen what kind of numbers the competition is capable of producing as well. They seem to be having a hard time keeping up with demand at this point.

1,"paris (reuters) - a major european carmaker could be brought “to its knees” by carbon dioxide emissions fines, allowing a chinese buyer to step in with its own electric vehicle technology, peugeot maker psa group’s chief executive said. carlos tavares, chairman of the managing board of groupe psa, speaks during a presentation during the 88th international motor show at palexpo in geneva, switzerland, march 6, 2018. reuters/denis balibouse/file photo carlos tavares, who chairs european auto industry lobby group acea, said that policymakers had failed to anticipate this outcome of the european union’s 2020 co2 goals. “the impact is very obvious. it’s going to create a chinese trojan horse in europe,” tavares told an industry event hosted by french car magazine le journal de l’auto late on wednesday. his outspoken comments come against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between china and the united states and wider concerns about growing protectionism worldwide. they also underscore concerns about foreign influence over european manufacturers, jobs and technology, which have risen since china’s geely snapped up 10 percent of germany’s daimler in february. “if a european carmaker missed its (co2) targets and was brought to its knees by fines, it could not be acquired by another big european carmaker purely because of antitrust rules,” tavares said, without naming any manufacturer. that would create the opportunity for a foreign investor to bring in the kind of technology “imposed by european authorities, which means electric vehicles,” he said. “and who’s the leader in electrification? it’s the chinese,” he added. paris-based psa, itself 12.2 percent-owned by china’s dongfeng motor corp., has accelerated new vehicle development at opel and vauxhall after uncovering what tavares described as hidden co2 emissions problems following the brands’ acquisition from general motors last year. thanks to the extra investment, the group maintains it is now on track to meet co2 goals averaging 95 grammes per kilometer being phased in from 2020-2021, backed by hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines for non-compliance. the current eu-mandated average for new cars is 130 g/km. tavares has called for the eu penalties to be suspended until governments roll out adequate electric-car charging networks, saying last month he planned to raise the proposal at a meeting of brussels-based acea on march 7. “acea has not approached the european commission to reopen any discussion of the 2020 goals,” a spokeswoman told reuters. president donald trump’s administration moved this week to weaken u.s. fuel-economy goals previously agreed for 2022-25 in response to calls for a revision by carmakers. psa and other european carmakers are facing declining sales of fuel-efficient diesel models, making it harder to meet co2 targets and avoid large fines. reporting by laurence frost; editing by alexander smith",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"singapore (reuters) - nissan motor co ( 7201.t ) said on tuesday it will launch the new version of its all-electric vehicle leaf in seven markets in asia-pacific, and explore bringing it to two more, in its latest push to boost sales of electrified vehicles. lower-emission vehicles have become a major priority for the world’s top automakers, who are poised to introduce dozens of new battery electric and hybrid gasoline-electric models over the next five years. nissan, japan’s no. 2 automaker, will launch the model in australia, hong kong, malaysia, new zealand, singapore, south korea and thailand during the next fiscal year, and also explore introducing it in indonesia and the philippines. the company is also looking at the option of bringing vehicles based on its “e-power” gasoline hybrid technology to southeast asia. “we are seriously planning. i want to find some good chance to announce some concrete timing in the market,” yutaka sanada, nissan’s regional head, said when asked about the company’s plans for “e-power” technology in southeast asia. he said the technology was a “very good bridge” to attract car buyers to try electric vehicles as it gave the experience of driving an electric car, but did not require charging stations. currently, electric cars account for a small portion of the market in southeast asia, due to low affordability and the lack of charging infrastructure. for example, the share of hybrid and electric vehicles in 2017 was less than 2 percent in thailand and 0.4 percent in indonesia compared with japan’s 27.3 percent, data from lmc automotive shows. sanada said that while there were no immediate plans to produce electric vehicles in southeast asia, nissan would consider local manufacturing depending on market growth. “once regional demand is to some size, of course in order to keep efficiency, we consider local production. it is normal for all manufacturers,” said sanada, a regional senior vice president at nissan. he said the company was discussing a number of ideas, including the expansion of charging stations, with the government in thailand, which is offering incentives to car manufacturers to localize. such discussions included potentially manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries in the country, but there were no concrete plans yet, sanada said. reporting by aradhana aravindanediting by muralikumar anantharaman",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"april 26, 2018 / 7:01 pm / updated 2 hours ago musk's 'no new capital' promise faces scrutiny when tesla reports results alexandria sage 5 min read san francisco (reuters) - investors are accustomed to the bold promises of tesla inc’s ( tsla.o ) elon musk, but his assertion that the electric vehicle maker will not need more funds this year has many scratching their heads. how can the chief executive deliver on his many goals without a fresh infusion of outside cash? file photo: spacex founder elon musk speaks at a press conference following the first launch of a spacex falcon heavy rocket at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida, u.s., february 6, 2018. reuters/joe skipper/file photo the california-based tesla faces a crucial time in its 15-year history. production setbacks with its new model 3 - the hotly anticipated sedan tesla vowed would push electric vehicles into the mainstream - have cast a shadow over musk’s promises and judgment. a host of new projects in the pipeline, from a semi truck to an suv, now appear to some analysts as expensive, time-consuming distractions, even as rival automakers come to market with their own electric offerings. a capital raise would raise alarm bells with investors as the company continues to burn money. tesla reports first-quarter results on may 2. understanding musk’s bullish prediction is a complex accounting exercise that relies on multiple best-case scenarios. these include: building a promised 5,000 model 3 sedans per week by the end of the second quarter; curtailing or deferring high spending that added up to $3.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2017; and improving gross margins. the dearth of information about tesla’s multiple capital-intensive projects - from the model y crossover this year, the partially built battery gigafactory in nevada, and the semi truck and roadster, forecast to begin production in 2019 and 2020 - complicates the task. “there are a lot of moving parts there,” andrew walker of rangeley capital, which holds a small short position in tesla, said on wednesday. “it’s just so many questions and such a black box, it’s very difficult to determine going forward.” shorts bet that a share price will fall. tesla shares were up 1 percent at $283.67 on thursday afternoon. its shares have fallen over 9 percent so far this year. ubs analyst colin langan has estimated that tesla - which ended 2017 with $3.37 billion in cash - could fall below a cushion of $1 billion at the end of june due to estimated negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. some, like bernstein, put that estimate higher, at negative $1.8 billion. related coverage tesla's board against proposal to require independent chairman subtracting another $1.2 billion for 2018 debt refinancing and accrued liabilities reduces tesla’s cash level to $600 million, ubs calculates. using a more bullish free cash flow model, such as morgan stanley’s first-half estimate of negative $880 million, tesla would still hover just above the cushion, at $1.3 billion. “tesla may not ‘need’ to raise funds, but many investors expect that the company will very much ‘want’ to,” wrote morgan stanley’s adam jonas in a note published last week. much hinges on efficient, volume production of the model 3 along with tight spending control. tesla aims to build 3,000-4,000 model 3s per week next month, up from more than 2,000 model 3s today, and to increase production to 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. building 5,000 model 3s per week priced at $44,000 would yield revenue of $2.64 billion per quarter, although efficiency determines how much of that trickles down to the bottom line. but those calculations may be moot. morgan stanley’s jonas noted that “no investor that we have spoken to expects model 3 production of 5k/week by the end of 2q’18.” ‘losing credibility’ tesla has repeatedly underestimated its capital requirements and has raised money, whether through equity or debt, even after claiming it had no need to do so. “the company’s financial predictions may be losing credibility within the financial community,” wrote cowen & co analyst jeffrey osborne in a note to clients earlier this month. since march, short interest in the stock has risen sharply to 30 percent of float, or shares available for trading. currently, analysts, on average, predict tesla will not reach profitability on a non-gaap basis until the first quarter of 2019. according to thomson reuters data, analysts see adjusted losses of $217.6 million and $40.1 million in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, after revising estimates downward to twice the losses they expected at the end of 2017. they expect, on average, negative cash flow of $125 million and $67 million in the third and fourth quarters. other one-off factors influencing profit include the sale of zero emission vehicle (zev) credits or deposits from model y customers. musk’s recent admission that he erred in adding too much automation into the model 3 assembly line could also prove an expensive mistake to unwind. the model 3 targets a 25 percent gross margin when fully ramped, but with production line stoppages and the need to hire 400 more hourly workers, the vehicle’s negative margins today could be further pressured in the short-term. with all that in mind, a 2018 capital raise, according to ubs’s langan, is “a question of when, not if.” reporting by alexandria sage;

1,"01 pm / in 28 minutes german battery maker sonnen to link up electric car users reuters staff * battery firm rolls out car chargers to online community * solar panel owners can step up power sharing, adding cars * looking for partners in car, transmission grid sectors by vera eckert frankfurt, feb 22 (reuters) - german solar battery maker sonnen is giving away electric car plugs to new household customers, seeking to attract drivers frustrated by the slow roll-out of shared charging points and link them up to better manage power demand. the venture capital-backed start-up unveiled its 22 kilowatt sonnencharger on thursday for ordering by members of its online energy sharing platform in germany, with first deliveries expected by the end of june. philipp schroeder, one of its managing directors, told reuters the company hoped to create a network of electric vehicle (ev) owners to help manage the charging process and minimise disruption for power grids. “automotive and power network companies will have to solve these problems anyway and we are hoping for partners,” he said. “there will have to be solutions for mass charging, otherwise the move to evs will not work,” he added. worldwide, sonnen has sold 30,000 batteries for storing solar power, mostly to rooftop solar panel owners. its customers have the capacity to generate a combined 210 megawatts of solar power. in its core german market, some 80 to 90 percent of customers are signed up to the sonnencommunity, which shares power production, consumption and storage via data apps. customers that opt for a flat tariff get a guaranteed 8,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of power per year - more than enough for a typical four person household, which uses around 5,000 kwh per year. that potentially leaves them with around 3,000 kwh to charge an ev, equating to a driving range of 15,000-17,000 km. with the ev plug, customers can choose between slow and fast charging and adjust the required volume, helping to reduce the potential run on power during peak loading times that developers of ev infrastructure say could be a problem. sonnen also aims to market unused electricity from community members’ panels to the national power grid to help stabilise supply, and to market their battery capacity to absorb wind power whenever grids are unable to transport it to consumers. “access to car batteries would give us additional storage capacity,” schroeder said, adding this would cut down on the amount of wind power currently left unused at times of grid bottlenecks. sonnen, which sells to foreign markets including italy, the united states and australia, saw a 24 million euro increase in turnover last year to around 65 million euros ($80 million), schroeder said. $1 = 0.8121 euros reporting by vera eckert; editing by mark potter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"may 18, 2018 / 3:01 am / updated 26 minutes ago exclusive: toyota plans to roll into china's ev market in gac motor vehicle norihiko shirouzu 5 min read beijing (reuters) - toyota motor corp ( 7203.t ) is taking an unprecedented route to meet china’s stringent green car quotas: its showrooms will sell an electric vehicle without the japanese company’s distinctive triple-oval logo. file photo: the logo of gac group is pictured at its booth during the auto china 2016 auto show in beijing, china, april 26, 2016. reuters/kim kyung-hoon/file photo instead, it will feature the label of gac motor ( 601238.ss ), toyota’s chinese partner, and will be built around gac’s lower-cost technology. the move - a first for toyota - will give gac access to the japanese carmaker’s stringent quality control, prestige and sales channel. for toyota, it presents a quick way to meet beijing’s requirements that such vehicles represent 10 percent of an auto manufacturer’s production by 2019. according to two company executives familiar with the matter, toyota plans to start selling the gac toyota ix4 by the end of the year. the car is a battery-powered compact suv based on gac’s trumpchi gs4, and has been in development for two years. selling a car derived from a chinese partner’s vehicle would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. but the idea gained momentum at toyota because of the chinese government’s push to get more electric vehicles on the road, the executives said. the government mandates have spurred other new alliances, such as ford motor co’s ( f.n ) agreement to develop electric vehicles with zotye automobile co ( 000980.sz ). ford is waiting for regulatory approval for its partnership, which calls for designing and manufacturing several jointly developed no-frills evs and selling them through a new china-only brand. it wasn’t immediately clear which parts of the ix4 toyota would provide, or which company’s design standards were used. quality experts say gac cars rate relatively high. file photo: a man stands in front of trumpchi gs4 from gac group displayed at the shanghai auto show, in shanghai, china april 20, 2017. reuters/aly song/file photo according to jeff cai, a beijing-based senior director at jd power & associates, some of gac’s cars, such as the trumpchi gs8 corssover suv, already stack up well head-to-head with vehicles marketed by global automakers. “the gs4 is a good car with acceptable quality,” cai said. he added that the gs4 ranked no. 1 among chinese brands and no. 3 among all brands for initial quality in the compact suv category. one question, however, is gac cars’ longer-term reliability and dependability, cai said. under the new chinese regulations taking effect next year, carmakers must amass credits for so-called new-energy vehicles equivalent to 10 percent of annual sales by 2019. that level rises to 12 percent for 2020. new-energy vehicles are defined as all-electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid cars. although the ix4 gives toyota a cheaper and quicker way to meet the quota, it also shows the company’s anxiety about getting a toehold in the chinese ev market before its own all-battery vehicle is available in 2020, industry officials and experts said. “it’s a creative solution to a critical issue all automakers face in china: how to meet the strict production quotas for electric cars,” said james chao, shanghai-based asia-pacific head of consultancy ihs markit. until recently, toyota was one of the industry’s major hold-outs against full electrification. the company had planned to more or less skip battery-powered cars and turn instead to hydrogen fuel-cell technology as a mainstream alternative to gasoline-fueled cars. but china’s seemingly inexorable drive toward electric cars changed that attitude. at the beijing auto show last month, toyota unveiled plug-in electric hybrid versions of its corolla and levin, due to go on sale in 2019. the company is also developing an all-electric battery car of its own, which the company has said should hit the market in 2020. “all this means our partnership has entered a new phase,” the second toyota executive said. the gac-toyota joint venture, established in 2004, has always produced and sold toyota vehicles modified to sell in china or china-only toyota cars. to be sure, industry officials and analysts believe gac motor cars such as the trumpchi gs4 have been developed through studying global brands’ cars, including those from its partners toyota and honda motor co ( 7267.t ). toyota is negotiating to execute a similar ev deal with its second partner, faw group [sasacj.ul], but nothing has been finalised, according to the first toyota executive. both executives declined to provide other details, including a target sales volume for the all-electric car or a pricing strategy for it. toyota will assemble the vehicle at a factory in guangzhou. the second executive said, however, that toyota and gac motor would have to sell a “fairly sizable number” of ix4s to help the toyota-gac joint venture meet beijing’s quotas.

""the ntsb is looking into all aspects of this crash including the driver's previous concerns about the autopilot,"" said o'neil.

1,"detroit (reuters) - general motors co chief executive mary barra has made a bold promise to investors that the detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021. what barra has not explained in detail is how gm intends to do what, so far, no major automaker has done. the answer is a big bet on combining proprietary battery technology, a low-cost, flexible vehicle design and high-volume production mainly in china, according to six current and former gm and supplier executives and six industry experts interviewed by reuters. if gm can meet barra’s ambitious profitability target, then it will house two different businesses by the mid-2020s: a traditional focus in north america on trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars fueled with petroleum, and a global electric car company centered in china, branching into pay-per-use services such as robotaxis. barra’s promise to turn a profit is a bold claim in a market segment that has been driven more by government policy than consumer demand, and where tesla inc - the world’s largest electric-vehicle manufacturer - is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each quarter selling premium-priced vehicles. barra and gm have invested heavily in the electrification strategy, and worked during the past year to persuade investors that gm can compete with tesla by building on the success of the automaker’s latest electric vehicle, the chevrolet bolt ev, and cutting costs along the way. a key element of the plan, according to two people familiar with the company’s strategy, is slashing the amount of cobalt in gm’s new emc 1.0 battery system. the price of cobalt – the single most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells - has soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers. cobalt prices hit a record high this month on the london metal exchange. gm’s new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, these people told reuters. gm engineers are also working on other design and technological advances, according to executives and company patent filings, including more efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells. without providing details, gm has said it expects these changes to cut the cost of battery cells by more than 30 percent, from $145 per kilowatt-hour to less than $100 by 2021. battery experts said the full cost of a gm battery pack, such as the one used now in the bolt ev, is $10,000-$12,000, or nearly one-third of the car’s $36,000 sticker price. by 2021, however, that price could drop to $6,000, according to consultant jon bereisa, a former gm engineering director who helped develop the chevrolet volt hybrid and spearheaded much of the automaker’s early lithium-ion battery development. with improvements in battery chemistry and packaging, bereisa said, the next-generation bolt “could deliver a 45-percent increase in range for about the same (battery) pack cost, or the same range at 45 percent less pack cost.” pam fletcher, vice president in charge of gm’s global electric vehicle programs, and other gm executives would not comment on specifics of the new battery system, which is slated to be introduced in 2020-2021. to be sure, electric vehicles account for only a small fraction of global auto sales. like other manufacturers, gm is banking not only on reducing its own costs and improving vehicle performance, but also on increased demand driven by higher government-mandated electric vehicle quotas in china that are intended to help reduce pollution and the country’s dependence on petroleum. in addition to improving battery and vehicle design and performance, gm is working with chinese partner saic to reduce the cost of assembling electric cars. sources said gm and saic are designing dedicated electric vehicle factories in china that are far smaller, less complex and more efficient than a conventional car plant. barra‘s bold claim file photo: mark reuss, president of general motors north america, introduces the 2016 chevrolet bolt ev electric vehicle (r) and the cruze hatchback at the north american international auto show in detroit, michigan, u.s., january 11. 2016. reuters/gary cameron/file photo gm has more capital for electric vehicle development because of barra’s decisions to sell money-losing european operations, exit other unprofitable markets and invest in a new generation of highly profitable, petroleum-fueled large pickup trucks, launching later in 2018. the automaker now has more than 1,700 engineers, designers and researchers working on batteries and electric vehicles, many of them at the gm technical center in warren, michigan, where the company opened a dedicated battery research center in 2009, a week after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization. automotive experts say gm’s battery and ev group is one of the largest in the world, rivaled only by toyota motor corp in japan and daimler ag in germany. toyota has patented more battery technology in recent years than gm, although its focus has been mainly the prius family of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, rather than on pure battery-powered cars like gm’s bolt ev. gm was issued 661 u.s. patents on battery technology from 2010 through 2015, the latest that such data is available from the united states patent and trademark office, trailing only toyota’s 762 battery patents among global automakers. for a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2chpwnx in addition to the battery work, gm engineers are developing a new dedicated “plug and play” structure for its next-generation electric vehicles that is flexible and modular, meaning it will be able to accommodate battery systems of different sizes, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, one of the sources said. in an interview, mark reuss, head of global product development, said gm’s strategy to reduce battery cost is not tied to a single improvement such as a change in battery chemistry, but rather a series of continuous enhancements in battery technology and packaging. “there are no silver bullets here,” reuss said. gm also has not solved all the problems required to achieve its goal, he said. “it’s called ‘product development’ for a reason,” he said. the most recent developments and enhancements in battery technology have not been made public, according to gm’s fletcher. “there’s a lot of stuff that we choose not to patent because we don’t want to make it visible” before the new technology goes into production, fletcher told reuters. lessons of bolt gm’s patent history since 2010 shows a focus on improvements in battery technology, packaging and processing, some of them designed to help boost the battery’s energy and extend vehicle range between charges, according to company filings. gm jointly developed its current battery know-how with korea’s lg group, which makes batteries and electronic components for the bolt. introduced in october 2016, bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles between charges,

0,"* estimated mine value has fallen to $400 mln -sources * sale prospects complicated by new mining code in drc * erg aims to reduce $6 bln debt burden by clara denina and dasha afanasieva london, march 7 (reuters) - debt-laden kazakh miner eurasian resources group (erg) has revived efforts to sell its frontier copper mine in democratic republic of congo (drc) despite a drop in valuation to about $400 million, two banking sources said. the company, which is working with vtb capital and rothschild to spin off and eventually list some of its assets, had already tried to sell its international operations in 2014 but failed to do so as the global economy slowed and commodity prices dived. erg, formerly known as enrc, did not respond to requests for comment. a sale, however, is now complicated by the drc parliament’s adoption in january of a new mining code to increase taxes and royalties for mining companies. mining and oil accounts for about 95 percent of export revenue. the industry has been lobbying president joseph kabila not to sign the charter, saying it would discourage investment and violate existing agreements. erg also owns copper and cobalt mines boss mining and comide and some development and near-production assets in the drc. one of the sources said erg aims to leave the drc within two years. “it doesn’t seem the right time to sell congolese copper mines — as there still uncertainty on the change in the mining charter — unless you are being forced into it by your creditors,” the second source said. erg amassed a hefty debt of about $6 billion to its main creditors, vtb and sberbank, after its three founders and the kazakh government took it private. chinese interest? a troubled six-year listing on the london stock exchange ended in 2013 after boardroom battles, corruption allegations and an investigation by the serious fraud office. the first source said that the company sent sale information documents to interested parties three weeks ago. “chinese companies already operating in the country are going to take a look ... they are the most likely buyers,” the second banking source said. china molybdenum, zijin mining group and china nonferrous metals corp already invest in the drc. other international mining companies in the country include glencore, ivanhoe mines and randgold resources . drc is africa’s largest copper producer, a significant gold miner and one of the world’s leading sources of cobalt, which is increasingly sought after for use in electric car batteries. the country, however, has suffered huge energy shortfalls, with its copper-mining katanga region receiving only about half the power it needs from the national grid, forcing operators to rely on expensive generators or imports. “the whole saga is a bit of a sorry one ... issues around electricity shortage and political risk in the country, coupled with lower copper prices, lower metal grade at the mine, which only has a 20-25 year lifespan, might have affected the valuation,” said paul gait, senior research analyst at bernstein. the price of copper on the london metal exchange has dropped more than 30 percent to about $7,000 a tonne since hitting a record high above $10,000 in 2011.

1,"london (reuters) - wimbledon announced a hefty prize-pot hike on tuesday, along with a new sustainability project aimed at ensuring it is not just the grass courts that remain green at the all england club. raindrops are seen on an umbrella at the wimbledon tennis championships, in london june 30, 2014. reuters/suzanne plunkett/files organisers of the oldest grand slam tournament revealed a prize fund of 34 million pounds ($46.57 million) for the 2018 championships, up 7.6 percent from last year. that figure includes awards of 2.25 million pounds each for the men’s and women’s champions – an increase on the 2.2 million pounds roger federer and garbine muguruza received in 2017. organisers also issued a warning that players who compete while knowingly carrying an injury, and quit mid-match, face being docked all their first-round prize money. the move is aimed at preventing a repeat of the rash of retirements in early action last year. “in the wake of first-round withdrawals we pledged to act on it, and we have done so,” wimbledon chief executive richard lewis told reporters. “we were very influential in the creation and adoption of the 50-50 rule and hope the introduction of it will play a significant role in mitigating the problems of first-round singles retirements.” under the new rule, if an injured player withdraws onsite after midday on the thursday before the championships they will receive 50 percent of the first-round prize money. the replacement “lucky-loser” will get the other 50 percent. with pound signs dominating the headlines at the club in leafy south-west london, tournament organisers also underlined their commitment to combating corruption in the sport and rolling out a sustainability programme. straw ban central to the “greening” of the championships is a ban on plastic straws — some 400,000 were used at last year’s tournament — the introduction of electric vehicles in the courtesy car fleet; additional water-fill points around the grounds and the provision of paper bags at wimbledon’s shops. “sustainability is an important and necessary area of focus, particularly for major events,” lewis said. “we have put in place a sustainability vision which is to sustain the running of the club, and the championships in a way that minimises the impact on our environment.” organisers also reiterated they would be implementing rules first announced last november. in addition to stripping players of their first-round prize money if they pull out of a match or perform to what the club deems “below professional standards”, wimbledon will strictly enforce warm-up timing to speed up the game, but will also extend the time allowed between points from 20 to 25 seconds. wimbledon’s 2018 prize money eclipses the 55 million australian dollars ($41.32 million) paid out at january’s first grand slam of the year in melbourne, but at current exchange rates is just shy of the 39.2 million euros ($47.18 million) on offer at the french open starting later this month. the u.s. open, the final grand slam of the tennis calendar starting in august, is yet to announce its prize money. wimbledon, the only grand slam event to be played on grass, will take place from july 2-15. this year’s championships mark the 150th anniversary of the club, 50 years of open tennis and 125 years of the women’s singles championships. albert ramos of spain serves to juan martin del potro of argentina in their men's singles tennis match at the wimbledon tennis championships, in london june 25, 2013. reuters/toby melville/files editing by ed osmond",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"january 5, 2018 / 4:29 pm / updated 19 minutes ago coal dwarfs battery metals in mining deals despite war on pollution clara denina , barbara lewis 7 min   coal and iron ore dominated mining takeovers in 2017, thomson reuters data shows, with buyers favouring the heavily polluting devil they know over the uncertainties of a battery-powered future. file photo: a view of the slopes of the banks group shotton open cast mine in northumberland, britain, november 11, 2016. reuters/barbara lewis/file photo  while the biggest deal was in brazil, china was a top player despite planning to reduce domestic coal and steel-making to tackle smog in its cities. elsewhere, miners haunted by the overpriced mega-purchases they made before the commodities crash of 2015 hesitated on deals involving the metals needed to run electric cars.  mining deals totalled $96.8 billion, based on 2,109 mostly modestly-sized transactions in the past year, thomson reuters deals intelligence showed. that marked a 10 percent increase in value from 2016 but fell far short of $150 (110.58 billion pounds)-$200 billion (147.44 billion pounds) totals in the boom years, after which miners had to write billions of dollars off the value of their assets.  for the graphic 'mining m&a deals', click - reut.rs/2crw7an  more than $92 billion of the 2017 total was spent on coal, iron ore and steel deals as investors stayed loyal to a sector that still generates steady profits despite the global drive to reduce pollution.  analysts predict continued demand, even though coal is the biggest source of the carbon emissions that the 2015 paris agreement aims to curb. steel-making, which uses iron ore and coking coal, accounts for an estimated seven percent of industrial direct co2 emissions, industry figures show.  for the mining sector, the minerals offer an established way of making money when ultra-low official interest rates mean relatively cheap funding is available to purchase assets.  “if you are a buyer, maybe you think you can squeeze some cost out of it thanks to the low cost of capital,” brewin dolphin equity analyst nik stanojevic said, adding that emerging markets such as china and india will continue to rely on coal for years to come.  demand from these huge and growing economies will help to counter the trend against fossil fuels.  norway’s sovereign wealth fund has proposed dropping oil and gas companies from its benchmark index while britain said on friday it will set an emissions limit on coal-fired power stations from 2025, forcing them to close unless they use carbon capture technology.  china is pushing to limit consumption of coal, which is used to produce most of its electricity. but its coal output will still be around 3.9 billion tonnes a year by 2020 and on friday it announced plans to create several “super-large” mining companies by then. cautionary lessons file photo: a digger at the banks group shotton open cast coal mine in northumberland, november 11, 2016. reuters/barbara lewis/file photo  demand for metals used in making batteries, such as lithium, cobalt and nickel, is expected to soar as china leads the shift to electric vehicles. but investors regard them as less certain to guarantee profits because prices are volatile and the basic minerals require additional processing for use in batteries.  lithium and cobalt cbd3 in particular look overpriced. spot battery grade 99.5 percent lithium carbonate in china am-995c-ltcb, where most lithium batteries are made, rose around a third in 2017, while cobalt prices more than doubled. analysts and bankers say mining companies are holding fire on battery deals due to the risk of paying too much, as they did for assets at the height of the commodities boom that culminated in 2012.  “we’re hoping the industry has learnt some cautionary lessons,” said analyst paul gait at bernstein, adding it would be very unwise to buy projects such as lithium in the current market. “it should be left to its own devices. the lithium price is coming down. there’s no way this is the bottom of the cycle.” future deals?  the most active dealmaker of the major miners glencore ( glen.l ) - whose $46 billion merger with xstrata in 2013 was the biggest mining transaction of all time - said repeatedly in the past year that it favoured bolt-ons and partnerships to avoid the high levels of debt involved in over-ambitious deal-making.  in 2017 the number of mining deals grew 27 percent to the highest figure since 2012 as miners focussed mostly on relatively small transactions, the thomson reuters data showed.  brazil accounted for the highest value deal, iron ore giant vale’s ( vale3.sa ) $21 billion acquisition of shareholder group valepar - although analysts said this was a matter of standardising the shareholder structure rather than constituting a classic m&a deal. it was the only transaction above $5 billion in 2017.  brazil’s mining m&a deals in 2017 totalled $22.9 billion, just ahead of china’s $18.8 billion as coral pearl international ltd bought iron ore mining international from neighbouring mongolia and a chinese investor group snapped up huaibei mining co ltd at home.  the mongolian deal falls under beijing’s belt and road policy of developing infrastructure beyond its borders. this has driven deal-making and allegations from western analysts that china is simply moving its emissions and excess capacity beyond its borders - as many western economies have long done.  china’s deals were down from $37.7 billion in 2016 following the imposition of capital controls, but overall   began to pick up late last year.  with president donald trump championing domestic energy production, u.s. companies including consol energy inc-coal assets and peabody energy corp also made purchases.  elsewhere, glencore did a deal with yancoal to buy a stake in coal assets that the chinese firm acquired from rio tinto ( rio.ax ) ( rio.l ).  shrewd future buys could include nickel or copper - minerals that gait predicted had further upside as well as exposure to the electric vehicle market that offers a potentially huge source of demand for big miners, once it takes off globally. copper is coveted as a mineral useful to both the old and new economies, but finding high quality projects to buy at the right price is likely to be hard.  bhp ( bhp.ax ) ( blt.l ), the world’s biggest miner, said it believes exploration, not acquisition, is the best way to find new copper supplies. editing by david stamp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"retail report tesla semi could save money over diesels within 2 years of ownership the tesla semi could recoup costs and begin saving over diesel engines in two years, piper jaffray says. there are still some unknowns around costs, such as potential battery replacements. shares alexandria sage | reuters tesla's new electric semi truck is unveiled during a presentation in hawthorne, california, u.s., november 16, 2017.  elon musk may yet convince skeptics that an electric semitrailer is a better buy than diesel.  tesla has said its electric truck will save owners money over diesel trucks over time, but skeptics so far have expressed doubts and have clamored for more data and validation.  a new report from piper jaffray suggests tesla semi buyers could begin saving money over diesel engines after two years of ownership.  factoring the costs of variables such as engine manufacturing, fuel/electricity and maintenance, along with assumptions about how customers are likely to use a large commercial semitrailer, piper jaffray analyst alexander potter said he thinks ev trucks will succeed.  electric vehicles do appear to cost much more to manufacture, according to potter. for example, he estimates the cost of all parts on a diesel truck that would not be needed on an electric vehicle to be $37,128, while the cost of parts needed on an ev (but not a diesel) would be much higher, at $82,720. that is mostly due to the battery pack, which is estimated at $54,500 installed.  however, the costs of repairing, refueling and maintaining an electric vehicle are lower. yearly spending on those expenses runs $35,676 for diesel truck. the electric truck would cost less than half, $14,306.  at that rate, electric trucks would recoup their extra costs over diesels and begin saving money in about 2.1 years, potter said.  other factors are needed for future versions of the payback model, particularly around costs, potter said. for example, it is not known whether fleets will need to spend significantly more to replace batteries as they degrade, or if they will be able to solve that problem by redeploying older trucks to lower-mileage routes. there also may be unforeseen maintenance costs or downtime and effects on performance from extreme weather.  tesla also said it has been able to improve range by reducing drag on the sleek vehicle as it drives. but diesel manufacturers could make similar improvements to their trucks, reducing the tesla semi's edge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""when you see this image for the first time it's quite striking,"" said dan ammann, president of gm. ""that's why we believe this is a notable moment on the journey to full av (autonomous vehicle) deployment."" the automaker has petitioned the federal government for approval to adjust 16 motor vehicle standards so it can test cars that have no steering wheel, pedals and other driver controls. if regulators in washington approve, gm plans to test up to 2,500 of these modified chevy bolts on public roads in at least seven states. the move comes as waymo, formerly known as the google self-driving car project, prepares to launch a ride-hailing program outside of phoenix using driverless chrysler pacifica minivans. those vehicles have been modified with sensors, cameras and radar equipment so the minivans can operate without a driver. unlike, general motors, waymo has not petitioned the federal government to allow it to test vehicles without steering wheels and pedals. last year, ford said it plans to develop self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, though those vehicles are not expected to be ready until 2021. freeing up another seat elijah nouvelage | reuters two self-driving chevy bolt ev cars are seen during a media event by cruise, gm’s autonomous car unit, in san francisco, california, u.s. november 28, 2017. so why would gm want self-driving cars without a steering wheel and pedals? mainly because the equipment frees up space and weight in vehicles that will be the heart of an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing program. since there will not be a driver in the cars, gm is taking the next logical step of removing the steering wheel and pedals, freeing up another seat for a passenger. what happens if there is an emergency or the car is not moving to the side of the road when it should? each of the new steering-wheel free chevy bolts feature an emergency stop button passengers can press if they need to stop the car. ammann understands some riders will be curious the first time they see these cars, but he's confident they will ultimately be embraced.

1,"the newly acquired company is poised to add approximately 1,000 new jobs and grow to approximately $100 million in sales over the next 24 months. fremont, calif.--(business wire)-- petersendean roofing & solar, the nation's largest privately held solar and roofing company, has just acquired hawaii-based haleakala solar. founded in 1977, haleakala solar is hawaii’s largest solar and battery installer. haleakala solar has been installing photovoltaic (pv) solar and water heating systems as well as battery storage solutions for more than 40 years and has completed more than 15,000 projects. there are plans to add roofing installations in the first quarter of the transition. the company operates on three of the hawaiian islands and plans to expand into a fourth in 2018. the newly acquired company is poised to add approximately 1,000 new jobs and grow to approximately $100 million in sales over the next 24 months. jim whitcomb, founder of haleakala solar, approached jim petersen, ceo and president of petersendean roofing & solar, late last year for a strategic purchase. “it seemed like the perfect synergy between the two companies,” stated whitcomb. “in 40 years, haleakala has grown into the largest residential pv installer in hawaii so it would only make sense to go straight to the largest rooftop pv installer in the united states when the time came to hand over the reins. we share a commitment to excellence and petersendean’s size, organization, and impeccable reputation will take the company to a new level.” this new acquisition now positions petersendean as the nation’s largest publicly- and privately-held roofing and solar company. “petersendean is a perfect fit for hawaii given our size and product offerings, in addition, we have the finance options to truly help the island community to install a new roof, solar or a home battery at very low monthly payments,” said petersen. “we look forward to growing our business in hawaii and adding more american jobs in doing so.” gary liardon, the president of the consumer division of petersendean roofing & solar, is heading up this transition as well as the additional acquisitions planned across the united states in 2018. “we are excited to add mr. whitcomb and the haleakala team to the ranks. mr. whitcomb will stay on and take an active role in the sales development segment of the company in hawaii as we add new verticals to the market and expand to the remaining islands.” this planned expansion will increase employment in this hawaiian segment of the organization to over 1,000 jobs in the next 24 months. currently, haleakala solar employs about 125. hawaii has long been a leader in renewable energy. in 2015, it set a mandate that 100 percent of the state’s electricity come from renewable energy by 2045. regulators also just approved hawaii electric’s grid modernization plan along with a suite of demand response and solar tariff programs. “solar is a critical part of the state’s energy portfolio. the islands are a virtual incubator for all new technology in this space especially because of the state mandates that require all of the islands to be operating on 100 percent renewable energy by 2045,” said liardon. “hawaii already boasts some of the highest shares of renewable energy in the country, all on islands isolated from the stability of neighboring grids. that’s made them a natural testing ground for new technologies and regulatory models, including battery-backed solar and wind farms, aggregated demand response and energy storage, peak-shifting electric vehicle charging, and voltage-smoothing smart inverters and grid power electronics.” petersendean continues to represent stability and innovation in both renewable energy and home improvement markets. the company’s solid fiscal performance and scalable systematic approach are paving the way for substantial growth over the next few years. “with the balance sheet, leadership, and strategic growth roadmap currently in place the company is on pace to grow from $400 million to over $1 billion in revenues over the next few years,” said petersen. about petersendean roofing & solar founded in 1984 by jim petersen, petersendean is the largest, full-service, privately-held roofing and solar company in the united states. specializing in new residential and commercial construction, petersendean works with some of the nation's largest builders and developers. with more than a million roofs under its belt, the fremont, calif.-based company employs 3,000 workers and operates in seven states: arizona, california, colorado, florida, nevada, oklahoma and texas. please visit http://www.petersendean.com/ for more details. view source version on businesswire.com :

0,"california’s division of occupational safety and health has opened an investigation into tesla and workplace hazards at its fremont., calif., factory in the midst of an aggressive move by ceo elon musk to run the plant around the clock to meet production targets for its new model 3 electric vehicle. the investigation comes just days after the center for investigative reporting’s reveal published a lengthy report about worker safety at tesla’s fremont factory, where the model s sedan, model x suv, and new mass-market model 3 is produced. the report uncovered evidence that tesla had underreported worker injuries to regulators. however, it’s not clear if the reveal report or a complaint from a tesla employee prompted osha to launch its investigation. the osha investigation, first reported by bloomberg , comes at a critical time for tesla, which has been plagued by a string of problems in recent months, notably a failure to reach its production targets for the model 3. tesla has also been engaged in a public fight this month with the national transportation safety board over its investigation of a fatal model x crash near san francisco. tesla’s model 3 production problems were first revealed in early october when the automaker reported it had produced just 260 of its new model 3 electric cars in the third quarter and delivered only 220. production improved to 2,425 model 3s in the fourth quarter and 1,542 deliveries, but it was still below expectations. tesla reported in april that it had fallen short of its target to produce 2,500 model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter. the company produced 2,020 model 3 vehicles in a week at the end of the quarter, prompting musk to admit that his reliance on automation had caused production bottlenecks. tesla plans to operate its factory all day, every day in an effort to increase weekly production of its model 3 cars to 6,000 by the end of june, according to an internal email that musk sent to employees on tuesday. musk said the company would add another shift to be able to run the factory 24 hours a day, seven days a week. but that push could be hamstrung by an investigation that will examine workplace hazards at the plant. tesla is required by california law to submit log 300 records of injuries and illnesses. the reveal report said some of those injuries were not reported, making tesla’s safety record appear to be better than it was. tesla has come under fire for its safety record before. last may, worksafe, a worker safety advocacy group, found injury rates at the plant were well above the industry average in 2014 and 2015. worksafe analyzed reports filed with the u.s. labor department’s occupational safety and health administration and found similarly high injury rates in 2016 at the plant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"ten american and foreign automakers went to the white house on friday to push for a weakening of u.s. fuel efficiency standards through 2025, while president donald trump used the occasion to launch a fresh attack on the north american free trade agreement that has benefited the companies. a draft proposal circulated by the u.s. transportation department would freeze fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, rather than allowing them to increase as previously planned. trump's administration is expected to formally unveil the proposal later this month or in june. ""we're working on cafe standards, environmental controls,"" trump told reporters at the top of the meeting, referring to the corporate average fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks in the united states. trump said he wants automakers to build more vehicles in the united states and export more vehicles. but much of the hour-long meeting focused on nafta. trump blasted the pact involving the united states, canada and mexico as ""terrible"" and noted that negotiations to make changes sought by his administration were ongoing. ""nafta has been a horrible, horrible disaster for this country and we'll see if we can make it reasonable,"" trump said. automakers have called nafta a success, allowing them to integrate production throughout north america and make production competitive with asia and europe, and have noted the increase in auto production over the past two decades with the deal in place. they have warned that changing nafta too much could prompt some companies to move production out of the united states. the chief executives of general motors , ford , fiat chrysler , along with senior u.s. executives from toyota , volkswagen, hyundai , nissan , honda , bmw and daimler met with trump, as did the chief executives of two auto trade groups. major automakers reiterated this week they do not support freezing fuel efficiency requirements but said they want new flexibility and rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and the shift in u.s. consumer preferences to bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. fiat chrysler chief executive sergio marchionne told reuters before the meeting his company is ""fully supportive"" of trump's efforts to revise the rules and hoped for ""an agreed way forward."" automakers also want the white house and california to reach agreement on maintaining national standards, fearing a prolonged legal battle could leave the companies facing two different sets of rules - and the state level and nationally - and extended uncertainty. hinrich woebcken, chief executive of the north american region for vw, told reuters the meeting was a ""great opportunity"" to have an exchange of ideas about the future of emissions rules. california and 16 other states covering about 40 percent of the u.s. population filed suit last week to block the trump administration's efforts to weaken the fuel efficiency requirements. marchionne said he still hopes the administration could reach a deal with california to maintain nationwide emissions standards. marketplace realities u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer, transportation secretary elaine chao, white house economic adviser larry kudlow, environmental protection agency chief scott pruitt and white house aide chris liddell are among the administration officials who attended the meeting. mitch bainwol, who heads the alliance of automobile manufacturers, told a congressional committee on tuesday the industry supports ""standards that increase year over year that also are consistent with marketplace realities."" bainwol said the industry remains hopeful that there will be a ""negotiation"" between the white house, california and the auto industry. the industry also notes it faces rising fuel efficiency standards around the globe and is spending billions of dollars to introduce new battery electric vehicles in the coming years. democrats and environmental advocates plan to aggressively challenge the trump administration's plans to weaken the vehicle rules touted by democratic former president barack obama's administration as one of its biggest actions to combat climate change by reducing planet-warming emissions. the trump administration plans to argue the weaker rules will lead to cheaper vehicles, boost sales and employment and improve safety by prodding faster turnover of older vehicles. the obama-era rules adopted in 2012 sought to double average fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency to about 50 miles per gallon by 2025, but included an evaluation due by april 2018 to determine if the rules were appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"april 11, 2018 / 7:10 pm / updated an hour ago exclusive: tesla targets november 2019 for start of model y production - sources alexandria sage 5 min read  san francisco (reuters) - tesla inc ( tsla.o ) is targeting november 2019 as the start of production for its model y sport utility vehicle, with production in china to begin two years later, two sources told reuters this week, shedding some light on the electric vehicle maker’s next project that could tax its resources and capacity. file photo: a tesla dealership is seen in west drayton, just outside london, britain, february 7, 2018. reuters/hannah mckay/file photo  reuters has learned the silicon valley company led by chief executive elon musk is accepting preliminary bids for supplier contracts on the model y, a compact crossover companion to the model 3 sedan. tesla has given suppliers scant details about the program and had not provided a production time frame, but has now indicated the vehicle would begin to be built at its fremont, california, plant in november of next year, the two sources with knowledge of the supply chain said.  tesla declined to comment.  the new model y details show that tesla is pushing ahead on plans to build a new vehicle even as it struggles to produce the model 3, which launched in july. despite initially attracting about 500,000 advance orders in the form of refundable deposits, the sedan’s launch has been plagued by delays and manufacturing bottlenecks, postponing tesla’s anticipated revenue stream and exacerbating a cash crunch for the money-losing company.  earlier this month, tesla tried to reassure investors, saying its weekly model 3 output had doubled during the first quarter and that production rates would accelerate through the second quarter to 5,000 units per week, or about 250,000 vehicles per year.  competitive bidding is a crucial early step in the complicated process of automotive manufacturing. after the automaker discloses its plans, suppliers compete based on factors including cost and technology.  tesla issued to suppliers what is known as a “request for information,” or rfi, which gives a directional view of what will be needed.  with a new car model, automakers normally choose parts suppliers two to two-and-a-half years before the start of production. at about one-and-a-half years away, a november 2019 start date for the model y would be considered “aggressive, but possible,” said one of the sources. a shorter timeline is potentially feasible, the source said, as the model y will be built on the same platform as the model 3.  tesla is known for its aggressive timelines and high risk-tolerance in order to get cars to market quicker. to save time and cost, tesla made the risky bet to skip a pre-production testing phase for the model 3 in order to advance straight to production tooling, which is harder to fix if problems arise, as reuters first reported last year.  1 million model ys?  the model y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for tesla, which also launched a tesla semi and a new roadster in recent months. it is spending to build out its gigafactory battery factory in nevada, where battery module assembly issues have contributed to model 3 delays, and also expects to build a factory in china in the near future.  tesla has said it will not need to raise additional funds this year. but moody’s cited the likelihood of a capital raise of more than $2 billion in its downgrade of the company last month, spurred by concerns about cash reserves and tesla’s ability to meet production targets. the company burned through $3.4 billion last year.  without giving a time frame, musk in february told analysts the company would aim for production capacity of 1 million model ys per year.  the two sources said suppliers could be estimating an annual production of 500,000 vehicles in the united states, with much lower volume in china, likely in the tens of thousands. building 500,000 model ys per year would be the equivalent of what musk has planned for total production in fremont by the end of this year, although the company is nowhere near that volume.  suppliers generally use automakers’ production targets to formulate a good guess on how many vehicles will actually be built, based on the individual automaker’s capability to execute and consumer demand. one of the sources said tesla’s rfi was light on details compared with other automakers, and did not provide volume estimates for the model y.  musk said in february that capital investments related to the suv would begin toward the end of 2018. tesla has said its current factory in fremont could produce 10,000 vehicles a week - what the company hopes it will build in the model 3 alone some time in 2018 - without the need for a new building, although some in the industry believe there is not enough room at the plant to support that volume.  any major model y program would likely require a new facility, although low volume of the model y could be built on the existing model 3 line, the sources said. reporting by alexandria sage; editing by matthew lewis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"january 4, 2018 / 1:17 pm / updated an hour ago tesla model 3 delay raises cashflow risks, but analysts upbeat munsif vengattil , laharee chatterjee 4 min read  (reuters) - tesla inc ( tsla.o ) shares recouped some of their losses on thursday after falling as much as 3.6 percent, a day after it pushed back a production target for its much-anticipated model 3 sedan yet again.  analysts stayed upbeat, saying the electric car maker had finally set an achievable target for their mass-market sedan that is priced at $35,000. the delay, however, is likely to impact tesla’s cashflow, a big challenge for many quarters now.  tesla said on wednesday it would likely build about 2,500 model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. the company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.  “with absolute model 3 sales tracking behind expectations and model 3 gross margin improvement likely to be pushed out until production reaches greater scale, the expected cash tailwind from model 3 will take longer to manifest itself than was anticipated,” evercore isi analyst george galliers said in a note.  tesla, headed by elon musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the july-september quarter.  the company burned through $1.1 billion in cash in that quarter and said in november it would spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter. it had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of sept. 30.  chief financial officer deepak ahuja had reassured investors that cash flow would “improve significantly” over the next few quarters as tesla continued to ramp up model 3 production. slideshow (2 images)  tesla shares were down at $313.02 in afternoon trading. the median price target on the stock is $310 and eight of 25 brokerages covering the stock rate it “buy” or higher. eight have a “hold” rating and the rest a “sell” or lower.  “we believe that tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,” nomura instinet analyst romit shah said in a note.  “importantly, we believe that tesla is prioritizing quality control. while tesla’s repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,” he said.  tesla’s luxury model s sedans and model x suvs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, reuters reported in november, citing sources.  tesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous.  analysts said on thursday they continue to believe that sales of the model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as general motors co ( gm.n ) and bmw ( bmwg.de ) who are entering the nascent electric car market.  “given that tsla received over 400k model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think tsla could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,” baird equity research analyst ben kallo said. reporting by munsif vengattil and laharee chatterjee in bengaluru; editing by sayantani ghosh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"china may make it easier for foreign electric car companies to operate in the country, and new competition could affect homegrown vehicle manufacturers. the chinese government claimed this week that it will remove foreign ownership caps for electric vehicle ventures this year. beijing currently limits the size of the stake a non-chinese company can hold in a joint venture. the move, while significant, is unlikely to have a huge effect on already established joint ventures in china, according to james chao, the managing director for asia pacific at research firm ihs markit. chinese companies already operating with partners from outside china have ""developed a management structure and operational cadence with their joint venture partners that frankly works, and they'll continue with that,"" chao told cnbc's ""capital connection."" tesla wins? the most significant effect of looser restrictions from beijing would stem from the entry of foreign competitors such as tesla , chao said. the american electric vehicle pioneer last year started negotiations for a factory in china, but failed to reach an agreement because the government didn't want tesla to fully own the facility. a factory in china would let tesla avoid import tariffs. ""electric vehicle-makers like byd and maybe the new entrants as well — the new chinese entrants that is — will be affected by potentially a tesla or others that decide perhaps to produce their vehicles in china,"" chao said. miguel candela | sopa images | getty images a tesla motors official store showroom in wan chai, hong kong on april 7, 2018. that said, any move to lift caps on foreign ownership will serve its interests, by serving as a carrot to the u.s. amid trade tensions between the countries.

1,"may 16, 2018 / 10:26 pm / in 24 minutes george soros' bet on tesla could see other investors follow suit kate duguid , trevor hunnicutt 5 min read new york (reuters) - if tesla inc ( tsla.o ) chief executive elon musk needs to raise even more money, there may be a way. file photo: soros fund management chairman george soros speaks during a panel discussion at the nicolas berggruen conference in berlin, october 30, 2012. reuters/thomas peter/file photo on tuesday billionaire investor george soros disclosed a $35 million stake in tesla convertible senior notes during the first three months of the year. convertible notes give investors the right to trade their debt for equity at a conversion rate and are more appealing to the risk-averse, allowing them to benefit from tesla’s stock price rising while guarding against the risk that it might not. tesla’s stock price hit a high of $386 last year but has since slipped to close at $286.48 on wednesday. while musk has said the electric car maker would not have to raise more cash this year, wall street disagrees, with analysts saying the company would need to borrow if it continues to fail to meet its own production targets for building new, lower-cost model 3 electric sedans. investors who evaluated tesla’s junk-bond offering last year now say a convertible offering appears a more likely option than returning to the high-yield market. “it’s a wonderful trade,” said ross gerber, chief executive of gerber kawasaki wealth and investment management, who earlier this year bought tesla convertible bonds due in 2022 and said he is interested in buying more notes. tesla investors fretted in late march about the company’s ability to produce the model 3. a crash involving tesla’s autopilot technology and its falling bond price also took a toll. “the company is burning cash at such a rate that a capital raise is nearly inevitable at some time in the next three quarters,” henry peabody, co-portfolio manager for eaton vance multisector income fund, who said tesla would likely use a convertible bond to raise funds. tesla could not be reached for comment. “given how volatile the stock is, there are a lot of convertible players out there that would clearly like this type of paper,” said a portfolio manager at a firm among tesla’s top-10 bondholders. the investor, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak for the company, said they could be interested in such bonds. risk and reward if tesla’s stock price stays around current levels, convertible investors, such as soros, can reclaim the notes’ face value when they come due, a profitable trade if soros bought them at a discount when the bonds were under pressure. soros fund management llc took a $35 million stake in the tesla convertible bonds due in march 2019 88160rab7=, according to a filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. soros’ spokesman did not respond to questions. in the case of the soros’ tesla notes that rate was initially set at a conversion price of $359.87, higher than the $286.48 per share the stock trades at today. if tesla’s stock rallies past its conversion rate, soros could swap his tesla notes into more than 97,000 shares of tesla common stock, according to the bond’s prospectus and soros’ filing. that could make for an even more lucrative trade. either way, convertible noteholders pocket interest totaling 0.25 percent per year in the meantime. hedge funds also like convertible bonds because they can use them to amplify or mitigate the risk of a short, or bet against, a company’s stock. by contrast, with a junk bond, an investor’s best-case scenario is full repayment. stockholders enjoy fewer protections if the company’s finances deteriorate. some wary investors said a convertible is a better option for tesla than a junk bond, but not by much. after raising $1.8 billion in its first junk bond issuance in august 2017, the 12.6 percent price decline of that bond 88160rae1=rrps since it was issued means markets will demand a higher premium on future debt. thomas graff, head of fixed income at brown advisory inc, said a convertible would probably succeed although he would probably not participate. “a convertible would make a lot more sense given where they are,” said graff. reporting by kate duguid and trevor hunnicutt; additional reporting by alexandria sage in san francisco; editing by clive mckeef",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"detroit (ap) — for years, tesla has boasted that its cars and suvs are safer than other vehicles on the roads, and ceo elon musk doubled down on the claims in a series of tweets this week. the electric vehicles are under intense scrutiny from federal investigators, who have been looking into post-crash battery fires and the performance of tesla's autopilot semi-autonomous driving system. on wednesday, they traveled to utah to open another inquiry into a tesla crash — their fourth this year — in which a model s slammed into a firetruck that was stopped at a red light. a look at the tweets and tesla's past claims about the safety of its vehicles and autopilot: musk (from his tweets monday): ""according to (national highway traffic safety administration), there was an automotive fatality every 86m miles in 2017 ((tilde)40,000 deaths). tesla was every 320m miles. it's not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a tesla."" the facts: this is based on a tesla analysis of u.s. fatal crashes per miles traveled in 2017. the company's math is correct on the fatality rate involving all of the nation's 272 million vehicles, about 150,000 of which are teslas, according to sales estimates from ward's automotive. but tesla won't say how many fatalities occurred in its vehicles or how many miles they were driven. we don't know of any tesla fatalities in 2017, but the numbers can vary widely from year to year. there have been at least three already this year and a check of 2016 nhtsa fatal crash data — the most recent year available — shows five deaths in tesla vehicles. statistically, experts say musk's tweet analysis isn't valid. while teslas could have a lower death rate, it may speak more about the demographics of tesla drivers than it does about safety of the vehicles, says ken kolosh, manager of statistics for the national safety council. expensive teslas tend to be driven by middle-age affluent people who are less likely to get in a crash than younger people, kolosh said. also, tesla drivers tend to live in urban areas and travel on roads with lower speeds, where fatality rates are lower, he said. musk also is comparing a fleet of older, less-expensive vehicles to his newer and more costly models, kolosh said. most teslas on the road are six years old or less. the average vehicle in the u.s. is 11.6 years old, according to ihs markit. older, less-expensive vehicles often aren't maintained like newer ones and would have more mechanical problems. musk (from his tweets monday in reference to the utah crash): ""what's actually amazing about this accident is that a model s hit a fire truck at 60 mph and the driver only broke an ankle. an impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death."" the facts: it's true that the driver in the utah crash sustained minor injuries considering how fast her car was traveling. the same is true for a january freeway crash near los angeles in which the driver was not hurt. but not all tesla crashes end the same way. in march, the driver of a tesla model x was killed in california when his suv hit a barrier while traveling at ""freeway speed."" nhtsa and the national transportation safety board are investigating that case, in which the autopilot system was engaged. autopilot was also engaged in the utah crash, according to a summary of data from the car. last week, the ntsb opened a probe into an accident in which a model s caught fire after crashing into a wall at a high speed in florida. two 18-year-olds were trapped in the vehicle and died in the flames. the agency has said it does not expect autopilot to be a focus of that investigation. tesla (from a march 30 press release): ""over a year ago, our first iteration of autopilot was found by the u.s. government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40 percent."" the facts: the government says it did not assess how effective autopilot is at reducing crashes. it did mention a 40 percent reduction in crash rates after ""autosteer"" was installed in tesla vehicles, based on data provided by tesla. autosteer is the part of autopilot that keeps the car centered in a lane and can change lanes automatically. nhtsa said it did a ""cursory"" comparison of crash rates between vehicles with and without autosteer, but it didn't consider whether drivers were actually using autosteer, which has to be manually activated. tesla: the company has touted on its website and in press releases that the model s sedan scored the highest numerical rating of any vehicle in nhtsa's crash tests, and that the model x was the first suv to get a five-star rating in every category. the facts: it's true that the model s and model x got five-star crash-test ratings from nhtsa, and the model s did have the highest numerical score of any vehicle. but in more demanding tests by the insurance institute for highway safety, the model s failed to get the industry group's coveted ""top safety pick"" or ""top safety pick plus"" ratings. the reasons: the model s got an ""acceptable"" rating in a front-end small offset crash test that mimics when the front driver-side corner of a vehicle collides with a tree or another vehicle. its headlights also were rated ""poor."" vehicles have to get the highest rating of ""good"" in five crash tests to be top safety picks. fourteen large cars from other manufacturers received top safety pick or top safety pick plus ratings. iihs has not yet done crash tests on tesla's model x or model 3. the model s also had a low rate of medical insurance claims for injuries, tying for seventh in iihs's most recent rankings. the institute gave it a score of 46, which is 54 percent better than the average score of 100. the toyota camry, the top-selling car in america, scored 112. but the model s had higher collision claim frequencies and was more expensive to fix than gas-powered large luxury cars. find ap fact checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd follow

0,"by bloomberg 8:40 am edt elon musk may need to tap capital markets for more than $10 billion by 2020 to fund tesla’s automaking operations, new products and an expected expansion into china, according to goldman sachs group . while tesla (tsla) has access to new bonds, convertible notes or equity to fund its growth, each of those choices has downsides for investors, goldman analyst david tamberrino said in a research note thursday. “we see several options available to the company to refinance maturing debt and raise incremental funds, which should allow tesla to fund its growth targets,” tamberrino wrote. “however, issuing incremental debt (including priming current creditors with secured debt) may weigh on the credit profile of the company while issuing additional equity or convertibles at lower premiums would dilute current shareholders.” musk, who co-founded the electric-car maker and serves as chairman and chief executive officer, is furiously cutting costs to avoid raising capital this year, even cutting off analysts who asked probing questions on a conference call this month. the company is struggling to meet production targets on its first mass-produced vehicle, the model 3, and burned through more than $1 billion in the first quarter. the company set up a unit in china this month, taking a step closer to producing electric vehicles in the country and setting up its first gigafactory outside the u.s. the shares, down 8% this year, closed wednesday at $286.48, giving the palo alto, california-based company a market value of $48.6 billion. tesla had about $2.7 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter. tamberrino recommends selling tesla shares, and sees them slumping 32% to $195 over the next six months. sponsored financial content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, it has been 'close enough' as the miles remaining get smaller and more accurate while approaching my next Supercharger. But the reason this has merit are the lawsuits claiming the Model S/X battery packs are defective.I've read the 102 page, David Rasmussen complaint and realized his whole claim about 'lost range' is dependent upon the Tesla estimated range number, the GOM. In fact all claims are based on Tesla software reported values. I would feel much better about a lawsuit that has a 3d party, engineering team instrument the car.As for the temperature effects, one YouTube report claims deposition of metallic lithium at the anode (carbon) is reduced by charging at a higher temperature. Discharging at 'room temperature' seems to be the Tesla approach. Sad to say, I've not studied scientific and published papers but this makes sense: charge hot and discharge cool.Charging LiON requires the carbon anode to hold the lithium ions. A higher temperature should make ion movement easier into the graphite matrix so they don't collect on the carbon surface and precipitate as a metal. The risk is if the electrolyte decomposes leading to lithium ion capture in non-active salts and compounds.Bob Wilson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters.)  * global x lithium etf: tmsnrt.rs/2sfgptq  * lithium carbonate prices: tmsnrt.rs/2emxksg  by andy home  london, feb 7 (reuters) - tesla, the pioneer of the electric vehicle revolution, is turning to chile to secure the lithium it needs to power its mass production drive.  tesla and chilean lithium producer sqm are “exploring” opportunities after the automotive company expressed interest in buying “important volumes” of the battery ingredient, according to eduardo bitran, head of chilean development agency corfo.  it’s an obvious place for tesla’s chief executive, elon musk, to look for secure supply.  the global lithium mother-lode is in the brine lakes of chile’s atacama desert.  and the biggest obstacle to its full development potential has just been swept away with the resolution of a long-running dispute between sqm and corfo.  the prospect of a wave of chilean lithium supply flooding the market sent the share prices of other producers and prospectors spiralling lower.  lithium bulls, however, needn’t worry too much just yet.  translating political breakthrough into production boom is going to take years.  and right now the lithium supply chain is still massively stressed as it adapts to meet exponential demand growth from battery makers.  which is why tesla is eyeing a direct path to the mother-lode. as ever with this company, the question is whether everyone else will follow where it leads. atacama peace deal  chile is part of south america’s “lithium triangle,” home to more than half the known global reserves of the mineral and the historic production base of the “lithium oligopoly”, namely fmc , albemarle and sqm itself.  the chilean government was as slow as everyone else to see the electric vehicle (ev) revolution coming but last year sprang into action with an international tender for lithium processing projects and a green light for albemarle to raise production.  sqm’s chilean expansion plans, however, were blocked by its bitter dispute with corfo, which allocates the country’s lithium production licences.  rooted in political intrigue dating back to chile’s pinochet era, the stand-off crystallized around a disagreement on royalty payments.  the drama has been running since 2014, the two sides locked in on-off peace talks and arbitration court battles.  the truce was announced on jan. 17.  in return for an overhaul of its corporate governance and a lift in royalties, sqm gets an increase in its production quota to 216,000 tonnes per year of lithium carbonate and the option of partnering with state copper producer codelco on its untapped lithium prospects.  the prospect of the atacama mother-lode cranking up production sent tremors through the lithium investment community.  the global x lithium and battery tech exchange traded fund was trading above $40 before the news. it touched a low of $33.05 on tuesday. global x’s holdings are largely of lithium blue chips. the hit on the junior sector has been more savage.  but sqm can’t switch on new brine capacity overnight, even if it wanted to. it is, moreover, currently focused on getting its joint venture argentinian project into production by a targeted 2020.  any lithium surge from its chilean operations could still be years away.  the removal of the political bottle-neck in chile is, wrote analysts at benchmark mineral intelligence, “good news for a lithium industry post-2021” but “until then the status quo remains.” (“lithium research note”, jan. 24, 2018)  graphic on global x lithium etf's reaction to the chilean peace deal: tmsnrt.rs/2sfgptq  graphic on lithium carbonate pricing: bottle-necked supply  and the status quo in the lithium market remains one of physical supply bottle-neck.  spot carbonate prices in china experienced another mini-surge over the second half of 2017, peaking at an average $26.18 per kg in december, according to industrial minerals (im), part of the metal bulletin group.  that was just short of the levels trading at the height of the original 2016 lithium scare, when exploding prices first grabbed the world’s attention.  once again it’s a sign of supply chain stress.  the recent tightness, totally unexpected, according to martim facada, lithium market reporter at im, was down to competition for different forms of lithium and processing constraints.  a production creep away from lithium carbonate towards higher-specification hydroxide has left the carbonate chain short of units.  the tension was extreme enough in september to lift the chinese spot carbonate price over that of hydroxide for the first time ever, according to facada.  meanwhile, the wave of new lithium supply from australia’s growing band of hard-rock miners is crashing into china’s processing limits.  “just selling to china is not the end of the story, it’s just the beginning,” benchmark minerals writes.  the transformation of lumps of rock into battery-grade lithium compounds is a long and winding technical road, requiring experienced navigation.  chinese processors were already working close to capacity last year, while the companies with a proven technical track record capable of building new capacity “are few and far between”, benchmark minerals says.  it may not feel like it to the owner of shares in a lithium junior, but the lithium bull market is marching remorselessly onwards, with prices outside of china still playing catch-up. tesla - leading the way?  which is why, of course, tesla is so interested in cutting its own lithium supply deal at its source in the atacama desert.  the immediate outlook for the lithium market is for more disruptive volatility.  competition for units, meanwhile, is only going to become more intense as ever more automotive companies take their ev pledge.  so far none, according to benchmark minerals, has actually locked in long-term contracted lithium supplies.  the current market battle is playing out between lithium producers and battery-makers. the end-users, the car companies themselves, have so far been largely by-standers.  that looks set to change.  and it’s perhaps no surprise that tesla, the self-acclaimed standard bearer of the electric future, is leading the way.  others will almost certainly follow, since the world’s automotive sector is just waking up to the supply-chain challenges associated with mass production of electric vehicles.  and if a straight-to-mine approach works in lithium, would it work for cobalt, another key battery input with an even more fragile supply chain dominated by the democratic republic of congo?  we may not have to wait long to find out.  there’s a sense tesla has just fired the starting gun on the next chapter of the battery metals revolution.

1,"berlin (reuters) - german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday played down the possibility of forcing carmakers to make expensive modifications to diesel car exhaust systems, as her new government tries to avoid driving bans in cities with air quality problems. file photo: an environmental activist protests in front of germany's federal administrative court, before they decide whether german law provides a legal basis for cities to ban diesel cars to help reduce air pollution, in leipzig, germany, february 27, 2018. the words read ""diesel exhaust kills."" reuters/fabrizio bensch the german car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated u.s. exhaust tests. tackling the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (nox) emissions - known to cause respiratory disease - is one of the most pressing policies facing merkel’s new coalition between her conservatives and the social democrats (spd). after a cabinet retreat outside berlin, merkel made clear she had reservations about carmakers being made to introduce hardware modifications, such as changing filters in exhaust systems. “the benefits and costs must be proportionate. hardware refits are relatively cost-intensive,” said merkel. she reiterated she would do everything possible to avoid bans and that she believed in 2-3 years only about 10 cities would have excess levels of nox, compared with about 70 cities originally. the issue came to a head in february when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles. experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in europe’s biggest car market. merkel’s government has been criticized for having cosy ties with the auto industry due to its importance for jobs and exports. france and britain have said they will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. diesel down sales of new diesel-powered cars in germany plunged by a quarter in march, according to the kba automotive watchdog. so far, germany has committed to software upgrades for some 5.3 million diesel cars by the end of the year to reduce emissions by up to 30 percent. with demand for electric cars growing only slowly, transport minister andreas scheuer has released the first 20 million euros of 175 million euros ($217 million) in subsidies to fund the purchase of electric vehicles for public infrastructure agencies. however, critics say all this is too little. juergen resch, head of the duh environmental group, criticized merkel and her cabinet for being “remotely controlled” by the auto industry. merkel, and vice chancellor and finance minister olaf scholz, a social democrat, stressed the auto industry was of crucial importance to germany. “we want it to be modern and future oriented,” said merkel. “we also have clear exceptions of the car industry that has clearly made serious mistakes. the customer or taxpayer cannot be made accountable for that. it must be mainly dealt with by the auto industry,” she said. she added there were no plans for a summit with carmakers and that the new government was not keen on pursuing “blue badges” to indicate how clean a car is, seen by critics as a form of driving restriction. “our focus will rather be on individual measures that spare citizens,” she said. the fallout of the diesel scandal, which has also hit daimler and bmw, is still evident with vw poised for a management shakeup which will include the departure of chief executive matthias mueller, say sources.

0,"february 21, 2018 / 7:20 am / updated 4 hours ago glencore hails strongest full-year results after commodity rally barbara lewis , arathy s nair 4 min read london/bengaluru (reuters) - glencore chief executive ivan glasenberg hailed the group’s results as its “strongest on record” on wednesday, bolstered by a recovery on commodity markets and said it had the assets to meet future demand including from electric vehicles. in line with other miners reporting this month, glasenberg said there were “emerging inflationary pressures,” but they had been offset so far by strong prices for byproducts, such as cobalt, and glencore was able to contain costs. glencore’s shares rose around 4 percent by 1045 gmt, outperforming the broader index. after outstripping its rivals last year, glencore’s share price has lagged in 2018, hit by concerns about instability in democratic republic of congo where it has major operations. the mining and trading company posted full-year overall adjusted profit of $14.76 billion (10.59 billion pounds). glencore’s marketing, or trading business, rose 3 percent to exceed $3 billion for the first time since 2008. it said in december its 2017 marketing ebit (earnings before interest and tax) would be above $2.8 billion. for the coming year, its marketing guidance is for a range of $2.2-3.2 billion, which glencore’s chief financial officer steven kalmin said was “an all seasons” range, mindful of price crashes of the past. inflationary pressures were linked to higher commodity prices and currency effects, but were “nowhere near where they were in 2007-8 when we were having to scramble to get talent,” he said. now it has recovered from the 2015-16 commodity downturn, which hit it harder than its peers, glencore says it will avoid reckless deals, buying only when the right opportunities arise, while limiting debt and rewarding shareholders. it recommended a 2018 distribution payout of $2.9 billion or $0.20/share, in two equal payments. that is above the minimum set out in the company’s policy of $1 billion plus 25 percent of industrial cash flows. difficult terrain as the easier access to resources diminishes, glasenberg says there is no option but to have the courage to tackle difficult environments. in contrast to its major peers, glencore has significant operations in democratic republic of congo, which is home to around two thirds of the world’s cobalt, a vital component in electric car batteries. the price of cobalt more than doubled last year and has risen nearly 10 percent so far this year, encouraging democratic republic of congo to seek higher profits. its parliament in january approved a new mining code, which could see royalties on cobalt increase five-fold to 10 percent. glasenberg said the draft had been drawn up without consultation and told reporters the industry as a whole was “really pushing to have engagement with the mining ministry”. much of last year’s price rally in glencore’s stock was linked to its exposure to battery minerals, especially cobalt, which glencore describes as a late-cycle commodity with a strong demand outlook. it says the other commodities where it has leading positions, including coal are in demand following a period of under-investment, and it has also made clear it wants to increase its agricultural foothold. in the depth of the crash, glencore sold 50 percent of its agriculture business in 2016 to two canadian investment funds, which helped to reduce its debts but limited some of the upside for its marketing business. glasenberg repeated he was keen to expand in agriculture in the americas and was assessing opportunities, but it would not be “growth for growth’s sake”. paul gait of bernstein, which rates glencore outperform, said the results were solid, and the reduction of net debt to $10.6 billion, representing a deleveraging of $5 billion over the year, was remarkable. referring to glencore’s ability to capitalise on an upturn in electric vehicles and energy storage systems, he said: “we see glencore as almost uniquely positioned in this regard.” editing by alexander smith and keith weir",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"retail report fuel prices are rising again just as automakers pull back on sedans fuel prices recently hit a 3-year high, just as ford said it will slim down its sedan and compact car lineup and move more into suvs, trucks, and crossovers. but much of the switch will include smaller, more efficient suvs that borrow elements from cars, and suvs may be helped by an increasing electrification trend, and further improvements in vehicle design and materials. the increasing number of safety, comfort, and entertainment features however, add more weight to vehicles every year. cnbc.com getty images a customer pumps gas into his truck at a gas & shop gas station in san anselmo, california. fuel prices are hitting a three-year high just as many automakers continue to shift their production lineups further in favor of crossovers and truck-based vehicles. ford's recent announcement that it would only make two conventional passenger car models for the u.s. market has left some wondering if it will hurt the blue oval if fuel prices spike or if obama-era fuel economy regulations stay in place. demand for sport-utility vehicles is expected to only grow. auto industry forecaster lmc automotive estimates suvs, including crossovers, will be about 50 percent of all vehicle sales by 2022. back in 2008, when gas prices were at a record high around $4.00 per gallon, sales were half that. but there are a few things to keep in mind with respect to this shift. first, many of the vehicles automakers are betting on, such as crossovers and subcompact suvs, are often based on lightweight car platforms, rather than the traditional truck platforms. in some sense, they are a new kind of passenger car that departs from the ""3-box"" format of sedan, which segments a car into an engine, a cabin, and a trunk. ""what ford is really talking about modernizing the definition of the car,"" she said. ""all ford is doing is taking that car platform and putting different shapes on them."" ford was bold in announcing they would do this, but they are hardly the first to make this transition. others, such as toyota , bmw , and buick have been more quietly shifting for awhile now. these vehicles have partially, but not completely, narrowed the gap in fuel economy with their sedan counterparts. for example, the ford ecosport subcompact suv and the subcompact fiesta sedan both get an epa-rated 27 miles per gallon in the city, but on the highway the ecosport only gets 29 miles per gallon to the fiesta's 35 mpg. of course, there has also been a remarkable shift of interest toward pickups and large suvs, helped in no small part by gas prices. the average fuel economy for full-size pickup trucks in 2008 was 15.5 miles per gallon, and the cost of regular fuel for a full year for this segment at that time was $2,808. in 2018, full-size pickup fuel economy climbed to 18.2 mpg, but the full year cost of fuel for the segment is only expected to be $1,936 — a nearly $1,000 difference. that said automakers have poured effort into designing more efficient vehicles to weather spikes in gas prices and stricter emissions controls. and they have made some impressive strides in building less fuel-hungry engines, lighter vehicles, and entirely new power trains. those innovations are seeping into the larger vehicle segments. full-size trucks, for example, can now be found equipped with 6-cylinder engines that perform as well as the 8-cylinder engines that used to be standard on those vehicles, and get significantly better gas mileage. for example, the base model ford f-150, which has a v6 engine, gets about 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway. transmissions have more gears, which means the engine does not have to work as hard to transition from one gear to another — in much the same way that it is easier to ride a bicycle with 21 speeds than it is to ride one with only 3 speeds. there are also ""start-stop"" features on cars that shut down the engine when the vehicle is stopped, and cylinder deactivation that shuts down some of the cylinders in the engine when they aren't needed — the way someone might only use one burner on a six-burner stove. gm uses this across its line, including in suvs such as the cadillac xt4 . jeep added a ""mild hybrid"" system to the 4-cylinder engine in the 2018 model year for the gas-guzzling wrangler, jeep's marquee off-road vehicle. this includes an automatic start-stop function, regenerative braking and other tech. essentially the engine shuts off when the vehicle is stopped or coasting, and can collect energy back from the brakes. these types of improvements have led to some sometimes small but also considerable improvements in fuel economy, in notoriously inefficient vehicles. automakers will look at making changes to a vehicle that yield only a few thousandths of a mile-per-gallon in fuel economy, including shaving the slightest bit of weight by changing a few components, using lighter materials, or making a design ever so slightly more aerodynamic, said carla bailo, president and ceo of the center for automotive research. ""they really go through everything,"" she said, and they add up as many little changes as they can to squeeze out an additional mile per gallon. the problem is that it is getting tougher and tougher to find ways to keep improving. ""the challenge is that all that low-hanging fruit, all those opportunities for improvement in the marketplace, have been realized already,"" lindland said. and every year, vehicles grow heavier and heavier, due to the ever-increasing number of safety features and other amenities, such as infotainment systems, customers are increasingly demanding in cars, bailo said. to keep raising the bar, and certainly to achieve the sort of fuel efficiency current federal fuel economy rules require automakers to meet by 2025 — 54.5 mpg — electrification appears to be the best option on the table. and automakers are already talking about electrifying much of their product portfolios. ford is among them. the company is going ""all-in"" on electrification , said president of global markets jim farley earlier this year. that includes the f-150. there is expected to be a hybrid jeep wrangler in production by 2020. in some ways, larger trucks might be the best platform for hybrids, which have a tiny slice of the total car market. at the end of 2017, hybrids and electric vehicles combined comprised only about 3 percent of all auto sales, bailo said. for one thing, suvs and trucks often have higher ground clearance than sedans, meaning there is greater distance between the frame and the ground. ""if you are going to put a battery pack in a vehicle, an suv makes much more sense than a passenger vehicle, because you have that higher ground clearance. you can fit a battery on the bottom of a vehicle rather than take up space elsewhere,"" said jeff schuster, who is senior vice president of forecasting at lmc automotive. oil prices are something to watch, bailo said. she thinks consumers will start to grow anxious if and when prices at the pump start to climb above $4.00. for now, though customers see no need to push toward more fuel efficient vehicles. ""there is really no demand for more fuel efficiency,"" lindland said. ""consumers are very happy with the fuel efficiency they are currently enjoying.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"* copper price rally has stalled * commodity price crash of 2015-16 hobbled investment * rio tinto has huge new copper project in mongolia santiago, april 10 (reuters) - the copper market will slip into a deficit in the 2020s after being in balance for rest of this decade, as major technological change drives demand for the metal and its byproducts, rio tinto’s copper chief said on tuesday. copper prices rose 31 percent last year on the london metal exchange, spurred by anticipated demand from china and tight supply. but this year they have struggled to maintain gains, reflecting the realisation that increased consumption from new technologies such as electric vehicles is still in the future. arnaud soirat, ceo for copper and diamonds at rio tinto, said the outlook was still positive. “tightening supply and solid demand are combining to produce a positive pricing environment,” he told a copper conference in santiago. “we anticipate global market supply and demand will keep close to balance in 2019 and 2020,” adding it would slip into a slight deficit in the 2020s. chile, the biggest copper producing country, and the mining industry have a challenge to meet demand, he said, as the world experiences a transition to electric vehicles and a more electrified economy. “in this transition copper and the co-products it makes possible will be more important than ever,” he said. rio tinto’s comments on tuesday are broadly in line with earlier predictions it has made that the copper market will be in deficit when rio tinto’s extension to its giant oyu tolgoi copper mine in mongolia comes onstream. before that, few new projects are foreseen after a collapse in investment following the commodity slump of 2015-16. consultancy cru said on monday it was not confident there were enough copper projects in the pipeline to meet demand for the metal over the next 16 years as output from existing mines dwindles. without new investment, production from existing mines would fall from 20 million tonnes to below 12 million tonnes by 2034, leading to a supply shortfall of more than 15 million tonnes, cru analyst hamish sampson said. the only way to meet demand would be for every copper project currently in development or being studied for feasibility to be brought into operation, along with most copper discoveries that have not yet reached the evaluation stage, he said.

1,"may 1, 2018 / 11:15 am / updated 8 hours ago tennis: prize pot of 34 million pounds on offer at 'greener' wimbledon ossian shine 4 min read london (reuters) - wimbledon announced a hefty prize-pot hike on tuesday, along with a new sustainability project aimed at ensuring it is not just the grass courts that remain green at the all england club. britain tennis - wimbledon - all england lawn tennis & croquet club, wimbledon, england - 2/7/16 general view of the wimbledon logo on an umbrella as rain delays play reuters/tony o'brien organizers of the oldest grand slam tournament revealed a prize fund of 34 million pounds ($46.57 million) for the 2018 championships, up 7.6 percent from last year. that figure includes awards of 2.25 million pounds each for the men’s and women’s champions – an increase on the 2.2 million pounds roger federer and garbine muguruza received in 2017. organizers also issued a warning that players who compete while knowingly carrying an injury, and quit mid-match, face being docked all their first-round prize money. the move is aimed at preventing a repeat of the rash of retirements in early action last year. “in the wake of first-round withdrawals we pledged to act on it, and we have done so,” wimbledon chief executive richard lewis told reporters. “we were very influential in the creation and adoption of the 50-50 rule and hope the introduction of it will play a significant role in mitigating the problems of first-round singles retirements.” under the new rule, if an injured player withdraws onsite after midday on the thursday before the championships they will receive 50 percent of the first-round prize money. the replacement “lucky-loser” will get the other 50 percent. with pound signs dominating the headlines at the club in leafy south-west london, tournament organizers also underlined their commitment to combating corruption in the sport and rolling out a sustainability program. straw ban central to the “greening” of the championships is a ban on plastic straws — some 400,000 were used at last year’s tournament — the introduction of electric vehicles in the courtesy car fleet; additional water-fill points around the grounds and the provision of paper bags at wimbledon’s shops. “sustainability is an important and necessary area of focus, particularly for major events,” lewis said. “we have put in place a sustainability vision which is to sustain the running of the club, and the championships in a way that minimizes the impact on our environment.” organizers also reiterated they would be implementing rules first announced last november. in addition to stripping players of their first-round prize money if they pull out of a match or perform to what the club deems “below professional standards”, wimbledon will strictly enforce warm-up timing to speed up the game, but will also extend the time allowed between points from 20 to 25 seconds. wimbledon’s 2018 prize money eclipses the 55 million australian dollars ($41.32 million) paid out at january’s first grand slam of the year in melbourne, but at current exchange rates is just shy of the 39.2 million euros ($47.18 million) on offer at the french open starting later this month. the u.s. open, the final grand slam of the tennis calendar starting in august, is yet to announce its prize money. wimbledon, the only grand slam event to be played on grass, will take place from july 2-15. this year’s championships mark the 150th anniversary of the club, 50 years of open tennis and 125 years of the women’s singles championships. editing by ed osmond",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"london (reuters) - investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks. file photo: a oil pump is seen at sunset outside scheibenhard, near strasbourg, france, october 6, 2017 . reuters/christian hartmann while shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes. uncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector. but a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies’ profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks. “2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,” said olivia markham, portfolio manager at blackrock commodities income investment trust. she expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years. ubs, rbc and jp morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while barclays analysts predicted on thursday that earnings for the european integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter. optimists point to developments like shell’s ( rdsa.l ) raising in november of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel. “annus mirabilis. highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,” bernstein said in its outlook for european oil majors. figures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. the msci world energy index .dmiwo0en00pus, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though brent crude hit 2-1/2 year highs. europe’s oil and gas sector.sxep, which includes shell, total ( totf.pa ), bp ( bp.l ) and eni ( eni.mi ), was the worst-performing in the region. little conviction oil majors’ shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. since june, the msci index has gained 20 percent but brent lcoc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after opec and other major producers agreed to cut output. the majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump. with production from u.s. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels. “there’s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. everyone is waiting to understand what’s going on,” said angelo meda, head of equities at italian fund manager banor sim. as well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters. whether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again. “from here it’s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn’t help you out,” said peter hackworth, oil equity analyst at goldman sachs. as well as the strong cash flow generation at the european majors, early signs of capital discipline among u.s. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year. goldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the brent price. scrapping the scrip one crucial component in winning back investors’ confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share. shell and bp have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. goldman sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months. average dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, hackworth said. but not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue. “the market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. so i think the market is overreacting,” said eric moore, european income fund manager at miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year. moore’s fund holds bp, shell, statoil ( stl.ol ), eni and premier oil. ( pmo.l ) analysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since october after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump – could also boost the sector. peak demand? investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets. “electric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,” blackrock’s markham said. some are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays. but the shift to cleaner energy doesn’t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables. nick davis, european income fund manager at polar capital, said he prefers total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power. but in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said. evercore isi analyst doug terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. for him, bp, shell, chevron ( cvx.n ) and conocophillips ( cop.n ) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note. “the historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. it failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.” graphic - oil prices and energy shares: here reporting by helen reid and ron bousso, editing by dmitry zhdannikov and david stamp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"liuzhou, china, (reuters) - inside general motors co’s vehicle assembly plant in this southern china city, many workers wear the red-and-yellow uniforms of dhl, the logistics company. the dhl employees work side-by-side with gm workers handling the flow of parts within the plant, which builds about 400,000 baojun brand vehicles a year and is owned jointly by gm ( gm.n ), chinese partner saic motor corp ( 600104.ss ) and guangxi automobile group. dhl assembles thousands of kits of parts daily in a strategy to avoid assembly errors, and reduce costs. at some gm-run final assembly plants in china, seats are unloaded from delivery trucks, put on a conveyer system that runs underneath an assembly line, and are delivered to the assembly line operator untouched by human hands. some parts are delivered by small self-guided robots that would be at home on the set of a “star wars” movie. gm is now deploying third-party logistics contractors inside all 17 of its joint-venture general assembly plants in china to transport materials, and manage parts warehousing outside the plant and delivery to the plant, a senior gm executive told reuters. outsourcing in-plant material handling jobs, traditionally done by gm workers, allows the automaker’s workforce to focus on the more critical work of improving quality and efficiency, gm china’s manufacturing chief paul buetow said. gm has not previously shared details of its strategy for using dhl and other contractors in its chinese joint-venture factories. early on in developing its chinese manufacturing, gm used relatively simple manufacturing systems, relying more on cheap labor than advanced technology. control of manufacturing now, gm’s chinese operations are deploying advanced manufacturing systems ahead of many factories in mature markets, and leading the way in many aspects of factory floor innovation. gm’s increasing use of contractors in china points toward a future where much more of the work involved in producing vehicles, or even all of it, could be handed over to third-party specialists, as apple inc ( aapl.o ) does by outsourcing production of its devices. established automakers have used contract assemblers, such as magna international inc ( mg.to ), to build small numbers of niche models. but union agreements have limited the use of outside contractors within many plants run by global automakers in europe and the united states. some electric-car startups, including nio, formally known as nextev, are already experimenting with handing over the bulk of production work to third parties. nio’s founder and chief executive william li, who has his entrepreneurial roots in e-commerce, has been lobbying china’s industrial policymakers to allow existing automakers to subcontract for electric car ventures such as his, so that startups could channel limited resources into technology and product development. under current policy, ev startups in china are required to have their own manufacturing capacity. buetow said he has “thought about” the possibility of fully outsourcing production, but has concluded the automaker should still control manufacturing. slideshow (3 images) “the building and assembling of vehicles is still a core competency for general motors,” buetow told reuters in an interview in liuzhou. “i am not sure we would ever contract that out.” it is critical, he said, to have the “technical control” necessary to build vehicle bodies with precision in order to assure crashworthiness. efficiency gain gm and saic, and guangxi automobile have roughly 6,000 employees at the liuzhou manufacturing complex. to support them, dhl has deployed 1,500 of its own workers according to dhl. cars have 20,000 to 30,000 parts, and modern auto factories often produce multiple models on the same assembly line. the parts kits, delivered in the proper order according to computerized schedules, help reduce errors. assembly line workers, for example, do not have to decide what color sun visor to use in a car. that choice is made by the people assembling the kit. parts kits put together by dhl are delivered by dhl workers just-in-time for a given vehicle coming down the assembly line. dhl uses a system for creating kits of parts that was pioneered by toyota and later shared with gm. according to gm, most of these dhl workers are doing warehousing and parts delivery to the plants. dhl workers who handle parts-kitting and just-in-time delivery to the assembly line are much fewer in number than those working outside the assembly plants and they do not engage in vehicle assembly work, the company said. similar outsourcing arrangements are being carried out on a small scale in gm’s north american manufacturing facilities and elsewhere, but “what we have done in china is more (evolved),” buetow told reuters, without elaborating. gm declined to provide detailed information on the presence of third-party logistics service providers inside its chinese plants, saying that is competitive information. gm china manufacturing facilities also have adopted technologies such as “zero-downtime” welding and other robots, as well as collaborative robots which work side-by-side with human operators on the assembly line, buetow said. as a result, gm’s chinese production facilities have enjoyed a big jump in efficiency, buetow said. buetow and gm declined to give specific data, but buetow said the number of vehicles assembled with the wrong components has fallen to a quarter of the level seen a decade or two ago. “you rarely see any vehicles that are mis-built at the end of the line these days,” buetow said. reporting by norihiko shirouzu; editing by joseph white and neil

1,"Basic AutopilotIn a rush, I left my electric razor and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine at home. In a world of disposables, the razor was easily fixed (Barbasol still tastes crappy) but a CPAP is not an off the shelf item. Used to treat sleep apnea, it ensures my sleep is not interrupted by short airway blockages. Then my wife spent seven days in the hospital.Easily confused by strangers, my presence anchors her in a safer reality to avoid more aggressive restraints. But her 24 hour care requires my sleeping in that abomination called a 'reclining chair.' It has two positions, seat parallel to floor or raised ~20 degree back. There is an extendable leg lift but the seat-to-back angle is fixed. Reclined, it is like sleeping in a bucket with the legs and knees above the rim. To mitigate, I filled the seat-to-back hole with spare sheets, blankets, and a pillow filler so I can 'cat nap' and be available to help the staff. My wife was discharged after IV antibiotics reduced the hand swelling and pain. So I took a nap at my Mom's home, packed the car, and we were off to home in Huntsville.'Micro sleep' is a thing that my narcoleptic wife (and late aunt) suffered. Involuntarily, the victim goes to sleep for 2-5 seconds with no warning and the most effective treatment is uninterrupted sleep. After seven days cat napping in a bucket chair and one post release nap, I was primed.Tesla's Autopilot has dynamic cruise control and automatic emergency braking to avoid running into things. The optical and ultrasonic sensor based, lane steering keeps the car from darting into a ditch or into on-coming traffic. It was on the leg to Decatur there were at least five micro sleep events that I was aware of and Autopilot kept us safe. I stopped in Decatur for a pee, stretch, and coffee break before driving the last 20 miles home.Micro sleeps are involuntary and detected only when the individual recognizes having woken up. When driving, it becomes either a head-on collision or single car accident. Autopilot gives them a chance to survive.Home again, I have my CPAP sleeping aid, my wife has her dogs, and me in familiar settings. Life has returned to what passes for normal ... but it is life thanks to Tesla's Autopilot.Bob Wilson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"london (reuters) - the world’s top oil companies are expected to generate more cash in 2018 than at any other time this decade after three painful years of cuts, but it isn’t party time yet. the shift in sentiment has been rapid as crude prices have risen by more than 50 percent over the past six months to reach $70 a barrel, a level not seen since the crash year of 2014, thanks to global supply cuts led by opec. only a year ago, many investors still fretted over the sustainability of the sector’s lavish dividend payouts in a weak energy market. now the focus on company boards is gradually switching from slashing jobs and investment to boosting shareholders’ returns and growth. with memories of the 2014 price collapse still fresh and oil forecast to recover only slowly, frugality remains high on the agenda of boards and investors to ensure that the energy majors produce enough cash to pay dividends while reducing debt that ballooned during the downturn. “the companies will need to demonstrate over time that lower capital spending can be sustained and that their dividends will remain fully covered,” said jonathan waghorn, energy fund manager at guinness asset management, which holds shares of chevron, total and bp. “we are cautiously optimistic on their ability to do this, given the dramatic cost reductions in the industry.” oil majors responded to the crisis by transforming their businesses, nearly halving spending, culling tens of thousands of jobs and diluting share value. in 2017, most companies showed they can adapt to a world of lower prices and even generate thin profits with oil at $50-$55 a barrel, without borrowing. this year, when prices are expected to hold around $60 a barrel, the majors will generate more cash than they did in 2011 when a barrel of crude traded at an average of $112, according to bmo capital markets analyst brendan warn. dutch shell appears the strongest performer among the group in terms of organic free cash flow - money available to return to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks after deducting capital spending, excluding revenue from disposals. shell alone will account for a quarter of the roughly $80 billion of organic free cash flow that the top seven oil majors are expected to generate in 2018, warn said. a chevron gas station sign is shown in cardiff, california, in this january 25, 2016 photo. reuters/mike blake/files this follows the anglo-dutch company’s scrapping at the end of last year of its scrip programme. these allow investors to opt to receive dividends in shares, saving the companies cash upfront but diluting their earnings per share. shell’s organic free cash flow yield, the ratio between cash flow and market capitalisation, is set to double in 2019 from 2011-2014 to 8.84 percent, according to bmo. the comparative yield for exxon, though a larger company than shell, will be only 5.39 percent, bmo forecast. bp’s yield will rise in 2019 to 6.55 percent while that of chevron will reach 7.16 percent. the logo of bp is seen at a petrol station in kloten, switzerland october 3, 2017. reuters/arnd wiegmann/files growth the priority for boards and many investors is boosting share value through buying back stock, reversing the years of dilution caused by the scrip programmes. for exxon and chevron the focus will be more on boosting dividends. “with the scrips coming off and share buybacks to commence, we expect an uplift in shareholder distributions by around $24 billion, led by shell,” warn said executives will also try to reduce debt levels that soared in recent years as companies borrowed to maintain dividends. “the best use of excess fund flow now would be a little further debt reduction for those companies that need it, and then an end to the scrip dividend,” said darren sissons, partner and portfolio manager at toronto-based campbell, lee & ross investment management. with whatever is left, sissons expects boards to invest a “small but increasing allocation to growth initiatives” such as exploration for new oil and gas resources, renewables and chemicals. despite the past cuts in exploration budgets, the majors’ output will increase until 2020 as projects approved during the boom years earlier in the decade come on stream. thereafter, the outlook is less certain but chief executives have made clear their current focus is on raising returns, not volume. forecasts of a sharp rise in electric vehicle purchases have weighed on the long-term outlook for the oil companies, many of which are increasingly focusing on supplying gas to the power sector as well as making small investments in renewables. reporting by ron bousso;

0,"president donald trump says his administration has ended more unnecessary regulations than any previous administration. in response to his orders, the transportation department has withdrawn, repealed, delayed or put on the back burner at least a dozen significant safety rules, according to an associated press review of the department's regulatory actions over the past year. a look at some of those regulations: automobiles —a 2016 proposed rule to require new cars and light trucks be able to communicate wirelessly with each other to avoid collisions, one of the most promising technologies for reducing traffic fatalities, is languishing. the white house has moved the proposal from its list of active rulemakings to its long-term agenda, which means no action is expected before the end of the federal fiscal year on sept. 30, if at all. the national highway traffic safety administration has said it is still reviewing public comments on the proposal and no final decision has been made. —a rule adopted in 2016 in response to a congressional directive requires that new hybrid and electric vehicles emit sounds when traveling at low speeds to alert pedestrians and cyclists to their approach. the government estimates the rule would prevent 2,800 injuries over the life of each model year of the vehicles. ten days after trump took office, two auto industry trade associations petitioned dot for an extra year to comply with the rule. the deadline for full compliance with the rule was sept. 1, 2019, but in a notice posted online over the weekend dot said is granting the request for an extra year, among several other changes sought by automakers. the new compliance date is sept. 1, 2020. commercial trucks and buses —the white house moved a 2016 proposal to require software in new heavy trucks be set to limit speeds from its list of active rulemakings to its long-term agenda. dot studied maximum speeds of 60, 65 and 68 mph. about 1,100 people are killed annually in crashes involving heavy trucks on roads with speed limits exceeding 55 mph. the american trucking associations, an industry trade group, has claimed credit for stalling the rule, saying it would create dangerous speed differences between cars and trucks. dot says it has limited resources and higher priorities. —dot has withdrawn a rule it was in the early stages of writing to require that states annually inspect commercial buses and other passenger-carrying vehicles. since 1990, there have been more than 220 commercial bus crashes and fires resulting in at least 484 deaths and 4,618 injuries, according to advocates for highway and auto safety, which tracks crashes through media reports. the obama administration proposed the rule in response to a congressional directive. twenty-two states already conduct annual inspections, but some states say they can't afford an inspection program. the withdrawal notice said there isn't enough data to support the need for inspections. pipelines/gas storage facilities —a rule proposed in 2015 would expand safety requirements for oil and natural gas pipelines, including greater reporting, inspections of pipelines within 72 hours of an extreme weather event or natural disaster, more frequent inspections using tools that can look inside pipes, and greater use of leak detection systems. the proposal was a response in part to a 2010 gas transmission line explosion and fire in the san francisco suburb of san bruno, california, that killed eight people, injured many more and destroyed or damaged more than 100 homes. a final rule was one step away from becoming law when trump took office. it was returned to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, or phmsa, three days later. dot says it's reviewing the rule because of concerns raised by ""important stakeholders."" —phmsa has proposed replacing the current pipeline safety classification system, which requires operators to take extra safety measures in high-density population areas, with a system in which operators conduct risk assessments to decide what extra safety measures are needed. it says it would save pipeline operators $1 billion over 10 years. pipeline operators have long urged the government to eliminate the class system, which sometimes forces operators to make expensive upgrades in areas where population density has increased. dot says the changes won't compromise safety. but a 2016 phmsa report to congress recommended against changing or scaling back the class system based in part on extensive public and industry comments. —at the gas industry's request, phmsa is reconsidering a december 2016 interim final rule to regulate underground natural gas storage facilities. interim final rules are used to skip time-consuming steps in the regulatory process in order to quickly implement urgent regulations. phmsa issued the rule in response to a massive methane gas leak from the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility northeast of los angeles. the leak began in late 2015 and wasn't fully stopped until february 2016. more than 11,000 people were displaced from their homes and many residents reported health effects. the rule requires industry to follow the american petroleum institute's recommended practices for the design and operation of underground natural gas storage facilities. the gas industry wants portions of the rule to be voluntary guidance, rather than mandatory regulations, and they want up to eight years instead of one year to fully implement the rule. phmsa has said it won't enforce the portions that have drawn industry opposition while it is reconsidering the rule. planes —an interim final rule banning shipments of rechargeable lithium batteries on passenger planes was one step away from becoming law when trump took office. three days later, the rule was returned to phmsa. u.s. testing has shown the batteries can self-ignite, creating fires capable of destroying an airliner. the rule would harmonize u.s. regulations with international safety standards. it would also limit batteries shipped on cargo-only planes to a maximum 30 percent state of charge. the changes were opposed by the battery industry and some manufacturers of products that use batteries. dot says the rule was ""pulled back"" because of concern about its impact on rural areas, but a new version is expected this spring. industry lobbyists have complained the rule might prevent battery shipments on smaller planes flying to remote areas. safety advocates say the destination doesn't change the risk. sleep apnea —dot has withdrawn an early-stage rule to require train engineers and commercial truck and bus drivers be screened for sleep apnea. the national transportation safety board, which recommended the screening, has identified untreated sleep apnea as a cause of at least 13 accidents it has investigated, including three commuter rail crashes in new york and new jersey since 2013 and a collision between a commercial bus and a tractor-trailer that killed 13 people and injured 31 others near palm springs, california, in 2016. dot said the problem is being addressed through current programs and through a proposed rule on fatigue risks in the railroad industry. the fatigue rule is years overdue. ntsb officials say dot's approach isn't working because sleep apnea-related crashes continue to occur. trains —a final rule requiring all trains have at least two crew members was sent to the white house for approval in december 2016. the rule was sent back to the federal railroad administration six days after trump's inauguration. it has since been moved from the white house list of active rulemakings to the long-term agenda. the proposal was prompted in part by a 2013 derailment in which a runaway oil train improperly secured by a lone engineer careened into in a canadian town, igniting a fierce fire that killed 47 people. most trains already have two crew members. freight railroads, which want to keep open the option of single-person crews as trains become more automated, oppose the rule. —dot has repealed a 2015 rule requiring train cars that haul highly flammable crude oil be equipped with advanced braking systems that stop tank cars simultaneously. most trains use conventional air brakes that stop cars one after the other. freight railroads say the rule's safety benefits are marginal and don't justify the cost. dot says its revised analysis of the rule shows costs would outstrip benefits. union officials say the advanced brakes are far superior to conventional brakes. —responding to a congressional directive, the railroad administration issued a rule in 2016 requiring commuter and intercity passenger railroads to identify their safety risks and create a plan to manage those risks. the trump administration has delayed the rule's requirements five times, most recently through dec. 4, in response to petitions from some states. the states have complained that they shouldn't be required to develop safety programs for railroads they sponsor, but don't operate themselves. dot says the delay will save railroads money and give the agency time to work out concerns raised about the rule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regardless, I've paid which means the functions that work on HW 2.5 are there and work reasonably well. With HW 3.0, a significantly upgraded image and sensor computer, more advanced features should soon work.Tesla did offer a subscription service, $10/mo., for traffic and internet over their built-in phone link. I declined as the traffic monitoring, weather, and internet access are superior on my existing iPhone and mobile hotspots.So our other car, a BMW i3-REx, required buying an OBD interface and iPhone software, BimmerCode:enable REx at 75% SOC instead of automatic at 6% - this makes cross country driving practical. We turn on the REx and drive topping off the tank when reaching the last 1/4 tank, ~20 miles. When the electronic tank level limit is reached, the engine stops and we have the rest of the battery, ~50 miles, to reach a gas station.enable 2.3 gallon, tank level - the physical 2.8 gallon tank is software limited on how low it can go before the REx is turned off, originally 1.9 gallons. With the coding, I've added 0.4 usable gallons, ~30 miles.default driving mode ""ECO PRO"" - the middle of three settings, it remaps the accelerator curve for a sedate driving style that increases EV and gas range. This avoids the inefficient, frantic accelerator behavior.added tire temperature to tire pressure display - I'm anal about running tires at maximum sidewall pressure and as close to perfect alignment to improve handling and tire life at a slightly harder ride. Seeing the temperature lets me know if there is a leak or just one side was in the sun or shade.declined to add AM radio audio - the AM traffic alerts still get through to the navigation system but there is no interesting AM content.Personally, I think BMW was a prick for not making these settings optional in their ordinary software. So I had to buy the OBD and coding software.One latent defect in our 2003 Prius was thermal mapping of the hybrid drivetrain. When the engine coolant reached a low temperature, the car forced the engine to run. So I used a TI-430 to spoof the coolant thermistor and allow engine off operation at lower coolant temperatures. Similar temperature flaws in the control laws were found in the 2017 Prius Prime that totally pissed me off.IMHO, Tesla upped the level not only with over-the-air updates but disabling fast DC charging in the car if Tesla decides it is a salvage. I understand there is a $2k, recertification, but I would seriously consider an independent, DC charging approach.Bob Wilson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 ideally nothing, but if you watched the recent netflix (nflx) documentary dirt y money , you would see a lab outside of albuquerque in 2014, where these primates are sitting in air-tight compartments while a volkswagen beetle’s diesel fumes are pumped inside. it was as part of an experiment paid for by the european research group on environment and health in the transport sector (eugt), a german auto industry group.  but it’s actually worse than all that. the beetle was 40 times the legal limit due to software that cheated the system. the tests proved that the vw car was polluting more than an old, 1997-year ford (f) truck, and the companies decided not to publicly release the test results.  the monkey experiment, conducted at the lovelace respiratory research institute in albuquerque, was sponsored by eugt. the goal was to create (bogus) scientific research proving that new technology had made diesel safe. eugt received all of its funding from volkswagen, daimler, and bmw. it shut down last year amid controversy over its work.  there was a lot at stake for the companies to produce industry-friendly data. europe embraced diesel in the 1990s because, on average, diesel cars and trucks produce fewer greenhouse gases than similar gasoline vehicles. but, by the time of the monkey experiments, the negative health effects of diesel were getting more attention.  a report released by the european parliament showed that 72,000 people in europe died prematurely because of nitrogen dioxide pollution in 2012. some european cities are creating zones that restrict diesel vehicles, or banning them outright. in germany, the highest federal court issued a landmark ruling last month that cities have the right to ban diesel cars. one of those cities petitioning the court for a ban was stuttgart, the home of mercedes and porsche.  volkswagen, along with the other german auto companies, also wanted to use the research to increase their diesel sales in the united states. that came to a screeching halt with “dieselgate” and vw’s emissions cheating scheme in 2015, which has cost the company more than $30 billion .  when i learned about these tests, my mind immediately flashed back to events in my 32-plus year career with the u.s. environmental protection agency. first, it was the time i was the director of the office of radiation and indoor air (oria), where we developed the first report about the dangers of secondhand smoke. our report got massive pushback from the tobacco industry, which created a variety of misleading research designed to confuse the public about the massive health risks of their products. cigarette companies had, in fact, run very similar tests on a variety of animals to prove that their products were safe.  but unlike smoking, diesel engines serve a purpose, are an integral part of the freight transportation systems of the world, and can be made cleaner. later in my epa career, as director of the office of transportation air quality (otaq), i led the effort that ended up becoming known as “clean diesel.” with the heavy duty diesel rule in 2000 , we took regulatory action to clean diesel fuel and reduce toxic diesel exhaust by 95%.  as a result of this rule , 8,300 premature deaths and 750,000 respiratory illnesses were expected to be prevented annually. recent studies by the health effects institute concluded that the overall toxicity of modern diesel engines are significantly lower than the high-polluting older engines, but even “clean diesel” is not perfectly clean.  what exacerbates the situation today is endemic cheating and the lack of consistent enforcement of the standards. in my 18 years as director of otaq, we had fined car manufacturers and diesel engine and truck companies that were cheating with polluting trucks for over a decade. just last month, new revelations emerged about alleged cheating by mercedes benz. and, there is money and politics as witnessed in the recent actions of scott pruitt, the current epa administrator, who is behind a decision to give compliance waiver to the highly polluting diesel truck “glider kits.”   so, how can we make diesel engines completely safe? realistically, we can’t. there is only one known, long-lasting strategy to address both human health and climate change: move to electrification of our transportation system. electric vehicles have no emissions and help mitigate the environmental challenge of our time: climate change.  some say the internal combustion engine’s days are numbered, and that may be true for light-duty vehicles nearing the “tipping point” for electric vehicles. but in medium-duty and especially heavy-duty vehicles, diesel will continue to play a role as we wait for technologies and infrastructure to become more economically feasible.  while the passenger vehicle sector is getting electrified, we cannot take our eye off diesel technology. it will be important to continue improvements to diesel engines—and especially enforcement of the rules—to ensure that their health effects continue to be reduced and their contribution to climate change is minimized.  but that doesn’t require industry studies of gassed monkeys.  margo oge served the united states environmental protection agency for over 32 years and most recently, was the director of the epa’s office of transportation and air quality (otaq) from 1994 to 2012 and a key architect of the 2025 ghg/cafe standards. she is also the author of the book, driving the future: combating climate change with cleaner, smarter cars. sponsored financial content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"as automakers and enthusiasts from across the globe meet in detroit this week for the north american international auto show, battery electric vehicles (bevs) will be in the spotlight. in an era of climate change concerns, bevs have become a symbol of innovation, promising to disrupt the automotive industry. yet hidden in plain sight are some of the most disruptive technologies the industry has ever seen; and they happen to be new and improved internal combustion engines. ironically, as countries announce plans to phase out gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles in favor of bevs, new fuels and engine designs are making ices greener than ever, and far more efficient. in fact, in many of the world's largest markets, on a cradle-to-grave basis, the most efficient ice has a significantly lower carbon footprint than a bev — mainly due to the carbon intensity of the electrical power grid and the environmental impact of battery manufacturing. over the past century, internal combustion engines have harnessed the unparalleled energy density of hydrocarbons, transforming our world and powering our economies to ever-greater heights. today's hydrocarbons (whether fossil or renewable based) meet 99 percent of the world's transport needs. as bevs overcome cost and infrastructure challenges over the next 10 years, they are set to increase their market share in specific segments of the light-duty vehicle market. yet forecasts by the energy information administration and the international energy agency predict that combustion engines will still account for more than 90 percent of global transport energy demand by mid-century. the anticipated growth of the global population to 9 billion, and the expected doubling of the world economy will continue to drive demand for affordable ice-powered vehicles. with combustion engines factoring in the transport equation for decades — and ice remaining the dominant power source for the foreseeable future — they must be part of any sensible climate strategy. improving the ice remains the most cost-effective and timely means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector — and those improvements can yield dramatic results. take gasoline compression ignition (gci), which boosts engine efficiency while reducing nox and soot pollutants simultaneously. gci uses market gasoline for diesel-like efficiencies in a cost-effective manner — with even greater potential using future fuels. at saudi aramco, we have demonstrated that gci can boost fuel economy by 30 percent. innovative automakers like mazda with their upcoming skyactivx engine are leading the way for gasoline compression ignition, with others expected to follow. some of the most exciting developments are radically new engine designs which save fuel and reduce emissions, like the achates power opposed-piston engine. the engine, which utilizes two pistons per cylinder working in opposite reciprocating motion, has the potential to achieve efficiencies exceeding those of diesel and gasoline engines by 30 and 50 percent, respectively. electrification can complement ice to achieve the highest vehicle efficiency, bringing together the strengths of both technologies. hybrids have demonstrated that ices, when paired with batteries, can run at peak efficiency. in addition to making engines more efficient, we can trap emissions before they are released into the atmosphere. saudi aramco has already demonstrated the on-board capture and storage of 30 percent of the tail-pipe co2 from a toyota camry. combining co2 capture with ever more-affordable renewable energy, and using proven synthetic fuel technologies, carbon-neutral combustion is already within reach. the global community faces a great challenge: reducing greenhouse gases and improving local air quality while simultaneously meeting the world's growing energy needs. addressing this challenge requires policies that promote a range of technologies, as those that attempt to pick winners are frequently counter-productive. we must employ a balanced approach, using all available technologies, if we're to achieve our energy and climate goals. neither the bev nor the ice is the perfect solution in all scenarios; both are needed for a sustainable and affordable mobility future. ahmad al khowaiter is chief technology officer of saudi aramco, the world's top exporter of crude oil and natural gas liquids and a fully integrated, global petroleum and chemicals enterprise. to learn more about the company and its participation in the north american international auto show, follow us on twitter @saudi_aramco and visit http://www.saudiaramco.com/en/home/news-media/news/naias-2018.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"(adds quotes, details, background) detroit, jan 14 (reuters) - ford motor co will significantly increase its planned investments in electric vehicles to $11 billion by 2022 and have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its model lineup, chairman bill ford said on sunday at the detroit auto show. the investment figure is sharply higher than a previously announced target of $4.5 billion by 2020, ford executives said, and includes the costs of developing dedicated electric vehicle architectures. ford's engineering, research and development expenses for 2016, the last full year available, were $7.3 billion, up from $6.7 billion in 2015. ford chief executive jim hackett told investors last october the automaker would slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars. of the 40 electrified vehicles ford plans for its global lineup by 2022, 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids, executives said. ""we're all in on this and we're taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we're electrifying them,"" ford told reporters. ""if we want to be successful with electrification, we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular."" general motors co, toyota motor corp and volkswagen ag, have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and offer them to consumers who want luxury, performance and an suv body style - or all three attributes in the same vehicle. mainstream auto makers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in china, europe and california to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. they also are under pressure from tesla inc's success at creating electric sedans and suvs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders. gm said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from those very same traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the united states and china. gm chief executive mary barra has promised investors the detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021. volkswagen said in november it would spend $40 billion on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 significantly more than when it announced two months earlier it would invest more than 20 billion euros on electric and self-driving cars through 2030. toyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars. ford's president of global markets, jim farley, said on sunday that ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020. the company will begin production of a hybrid version of its popular f-150 truck at a plant in dearborn, michigan, in 2020. ""what we learned from this first cycle of electrification is people want really nice products,"" farley said. 'think big' fords shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after hackett replaced former chief executive mark fields in may. the plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. in october, ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to think big and make quicker decisions. some of the electric vehicles will be produced with fords jv in china aimed at the chinese market. one aim of fords team edison is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to sherif marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification. china, india, france and the united kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

But the company still missed its own goal of making 2,500 cars a week.For any other automaker this would be a gigantic mess. For Tesla it's a win, and the stock rose 6%. At least it's progress, and all it took was the chief executive on a cot.Imagine if that same announcement came from General Motors (GM) instead of Tesla. Say GM was struggling to make the Chevrolet Bolt EV, and CEO Mary Barra showed up at the Orion Assembly plant with a sleeping bag.That's laughable because Barra acts like a CEO. She knows how to run a company without sleeping there.Meanwhile Musk is behaving like a college kid, staying up all night to cram for a test. And by the way, Tesla didn't exactly ace that test -- it still missed the mark.Tesla built 2,000 Model 3s in one week, but missed its target""We can't keep treating them like a start-up,"" Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with Kelly Blue Book, told me. ""We need some realistic numbers and we can't keep letting them break them.""Tesla may not have a 100 year track record of building cars like GM and Ford (F). Still, to its credit, Tesla has been a leading electric car manufacturer, and a huge force within the industry. So, maybe it's time for Tesla to act like a mature, stable company.Tesla should be setting achievable goals and hitting them regularly, all while making a quality product. Maybe that sounds like a lot. But frankly, it's the least investors and customers should expect from any company.""They made an announcement about hitting a 2,000 unit build rate [for one week],"" said Sam Abuelsamid, a transportation analyst with Navigant Research.

Tesla -- and Musk -- need to put on their big boy pants and stop announcing ridiculously over-optimistic goals and guidance.And if they don't, then investors and financial institutions should take that into account when considering an investment in Tesla, whether that's buying the stock, buying its bonds, or loaning money to the company. As has been said, stock price doesn't reflect how well stock buyers and sellers think the company is performing, it reflects how well they think it's going to perform in the coming months and years. By now, nobody should be thinking Tesla is going to perform as well as it claims it's going to.Make no mistake, I very strongly hope Tesla will continue to grow rapidly, and continue to push the EV revolution forward at a much faster pace than legacy auto makers want. But as a Tesla fan, it's downright embarrassing to see Tesla constantly miss its announced goals, to the point that missing goals by a wide mark has actually become expected.Time to grow up, Tesla!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"tesla could be the u.s. automaker most hurt by a trade war with china, says one analyst. and the other u.s.-built brands likely to suffer most after that are not american but german, said barclays analyst brian johnson in a note sent wednesday. while china is a huge market for ford , general motors and chrysler , all of detroit's big 3 have joint ventures with chinese companies that, for the most part, shield them from tariffs. gm, for example, assembles in china the vast majority of vehicles it sells there. tesla buyers in china, on the other hand, import their teslas, which means those buyers may have to pay a 50 percent tariff on those vehicles if china keeps its promise to retaliate against currently proposed u.s. tariffs. currently, imported vehicles in china are subject to a 25 percent tariff. wang zhao | afp | getty images tesla showroom in beijing, china ""the tariff will add an extra premium on top of a vehicle price that was already ahead of the base u.s. price, related to transport costs and duties,"" johnson noted. for instance, he said, a base model s 100d in the u.s. costs $94,000; the same vehicle in china today costs cny 931,000 (or ~$148,000. the tariff comes into play on top of those prices. ""and while these steep import tariffs are part of the upper-end luxury market (and in some respects add to the prestige factor for luxury cars), for lower-luxury vehicles than the model 3 a 50 percent premium would be significant,"" the barclays analyst noted. tesla was not immediately available for comment. tesla ceo elon musk has complained that the current trade rules between the u.s. and china are lopsided and unfair to american companies. elon tesla does have a pretty significant presence in china, and the country is important to tesla's balance sheet. the carmaker currently operates an 83,000-square-foot delivery hub in beijing, with a lease set to expire in april 2020. an sec filing also shows china was the second-largest market for tesla cars by revenue in 2017, after the u.s. and tesla nearly doubled its revenues in china last year, pulling in $2 billion, compared with $6 billion in the united states and less than $1 billion in norway. musk has also talked about building production facilities in china. for now, teslas sold in china are potentially at a disadvantage, johnson said. oddly, it's german automakers that are the next most vulnerable to a u.s.-china trade war. mercedes-benz exports some cars to china from its alabama plant, and bmw sends some cars from its spartanburg, south carolina, factory to china. but their exposure is still far lower than tesla's, johnson said. whereas about 12 to 13 percent of tesla model s and x vehicles go to china, only about 2 to 4 percent of mercedes and bmw cars do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2igoecu ) but gm’s mexican-made trucks already have a significant share of their value, such as engines, produced in the united states at united auto workers union-represented factories, and gm would get another boost if it is allowed to tally engineering done in michigan. gm is retooling a high-volume factory to build a new generation of large chevrolet and gmc pickups in silao, mexico. pickup trucks that do not have enough u.s. or north american content under nafta rules could be hit with a crippling 25 percent tariff. slideshow (2 images) last year gm churned out more than 400,000 large pickup trucks from silao, more than 40 percent of its 2017 u.s. pickup truck sales. fiat chrysler automobiles nv chief executive sergio marchionne said on friday a revised treaty could prompt fca to “redirect” some mexican production but would not cause it to further dial back its presence in mexico. in january fca had said it would shift production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from mexico to michigan in 2020 to reduce the profit risks should the united states pull out of nafta. senior u.s., canadian and mexican officials on friday ended a week of talks without a deal to modernize nafta, agreeing instead to resume negotiations soon, ahead of a deadline next week. rubik’s cube of rules the united states wants 40 percent of the value of light-duty passenger vehicles and 45 percent of a truck’s content to be built at hourly wages of $16 to qualify for tariff-free import from mexico. those demands are aimed at preserving relatively higher-wage u.s. and canadian production and pressuring mexico’s low auto wages. mexico wants 70 percent of a vehicle’s content to be made within north america, less than the 75 percent u.s. negotiators propose. automakers that do not comply with tougher u.s. or north american content and wage rules, if adopted, could face 2.5 percent tariffs on cars or sport utility vehicles shipped to the united states from mexico. that may be a level of pain they can live with. automakers producing sedans, suvs and crossovers in mexico include ford motor co, toyota motor corp, mazda motor corp, nissan motor co ltd, honda motor co ltd and volkswagen ag ( vowg_p.de ). the u.s. proposal would allow automakers to count salaries for engineering, research, sales, software and product development jobs, a provision favoring detroit automakers versus foreign brands. and companies would have two, four or nine years to comply, depending on the specific condition involved. still, some automakers are more of a question mark, especially when it comes to trucks. toyota plans to expand production in mexico of its tacoma pickup trucks, part of a realignment of its north american manufacturing that includes a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in alabama. it also makes tacomas in san antonio, texas, so could in theory switch production. the automaker declined to comment. and the trump administration proposals could complicate matters for electric vehicles and self-driving cars automakers want to build in mexico. the u.s. proposals call for 75 percent of an electric or autonomous vehicle’s value to be made within north america to avoid tariffs. since much of those vehicle’s value can come from batteries made overseas, that means automakers must make up for the content largely on the human side. at nine years, electronic vehicles are subject to the longest period until they must comply. “evs and avs have so much electronic content and there is no electronics industry here,” said kristin dziczek of the center for automotive research in ann arbor, mich. “nine years is not enough to build up an electronics industry to that scale.” reporting by nick carey; editing by meredith mazzilli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"31 comments the bankruptcy of the east coast’s biggest oil refiner has raised uncomfortable questions around the politically charged market for ethanol. the controversy has already hit some of the best performing energy companies in the past year. philadelphia energy solutions, which had its bankruptcy plan approved a week ago, was forced to file in large part because of the onerous payouts it had to make to comply with the renewable fuel standard, the rules that mandate the use of ethanol in gasoline. those rules, which took their current form in 2007 under the george w. bush administration, act as a gigantic subsidy for the farm belt and agribusiness companies that turn crops into motor fuel. as part of the bankruptcy, pes had some debts discharged , which is normal. but it got an added boost from the environmental protection agency, which allowed it to shed about half of its accrued costs to comply with the renewable fuel standard. the renewable fuels association, the ethanol industry’s potent lobbying group, called the epa’s decision “a forced subsidy from this industry and the american farmers that support it.” the irony of that statement is impossible to miss. the drama points to flaws in the system where the onus of ensuring that an ever-rising share of auto fuel is powered by crops falls on those who blend, market and refine petroleum. president donald trump, who is warmly disposed towards both corn farmers and oil refiners, had made noises as recently as early march about fixing a system that forces some refiners such as philadelphia energy that can’t meet the ethanol standards on the hook to pay others who can through renewable identification numbers, or rins. more heard on the street  why tumbling stocks didn’t tank treasury yields april 2, 2018 get ready for another lng boom april 2, 2018 fuel economy rollback is a chance to do better april 1, 2018 the rising barriers to global dealmaking april 1, 2018 spotify’s unspoken promise: a different business march 31, 2018 the gyrating price of rins recently have reflected shifting political bets on some reform of the system. another is the share price of cvr energy inc whose main shareholder, carl icahn, was a special adviser to mr. trump. cvr, facing a similar handicap to pes, is critical of the current situation, and its share price more than tripled between election day and this january but has since retreated by 22%. cvr and pes support a solution that puts the onus on the producers of ethanol to ensure compliance instead by having them certify that enough gallons are produced and to have exports of ethanol count towards the quota. a study by consulting firm energy ventures analysis estimates that complying with the rfs costs $10 billion in 2017 and that it would likely rise with higher rin prices. now that many vehicles and most gas stations can’t accept any more ethanol, rin prices have periodically surged and created a subsidy for some to blend 15% or even 85% ethanol and create a market for it. geographically or logistically challenged refiners like cvr and pes unable to blend enough biofuel themselves are on the hook for the cost. a compromise pushed by such merchant refiners that seems to be a non-starter with ethanol supporters would cap the price of rins at a modest level in exchange for the epa allowing the use of 15% ethanol blends during parts of the year it is now disallowed. a merchant refining executive speculated that their objection stems from not wanting the precedent of tweaking a system that keeps the industry in business, even if it would be mildly positive for business. there is an even simpler solution—freezing ethanol quotas at about 10% of the gasoline market, even if that market shrinks with fuel efficiency and electric car adoption. while that would be sound policy, farmers and ethanol producers won’t like it. that, in turn, could be political suicide for mr. trump or any politician interested in getting votes in iowa, the first stop to the white house. write to spencer jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"january 17, 2018 / 3:33 pm / a few seconds ago tracking europe's waste: 'there's gold in them landfills' alister doyle 4 min read  oslo (reuters) - some of europe’s richest deposits of valuable materials are in the trash, ranging from gold in smartphones to cobalt in electric car batteries, according to a survey of urban mining published on wednesday.  scrap vehicles, batteries, computers, fridges and other electronic and electrical waste total about 18 million tonnes a year and contain materials worth billions of dollars, the report said, urging more recycling.  a smartphone, for instance, has a concentration of gold 25 to 30 times that of the richest primary gold ores, according to the study, “prospecting secondary raw materials in the urban mine and mining waste” (prosum).  a database ( urbanmineplatform.eu/ ) tracks and predicts flows of materials in 30 european nations, from sales to the dump.  “this is one step closer to a circular economy,” pascal leroy, project coordinator and head of the non-profit weee forum based in brussels that promotes recycling of waste electronic and electrical equipment, told reuters.  “we’ve been doing the prospecting stage,” jaco huisman, of the united nations university and prosum scientific coordinator, told reuters. he likened the project to geological surveys for deposits of materials from copper to silver.  each european, the report says, would own 250 kg (550 lb) of electronics - 3.5 times the average adult weight - along with 17 kg of batteries and almost 600 kg of vehicles if all equipment now in use were shared out. file photo: pyrolised lithium-ion accus of laptops, smartphones and accu-powered craftsmen tools are pictured at the german recycling firm accurec in krefeld, germany, november 16, 2017. reuters/wolfgang rattay /file photo  it predicts, for instance, that a shift to more electric car batteries and more electronics in vehicles will make car junkyards more varied in a shift from metals such as steel and aluminum.  “for the first time we will see how the battery, electronics and vehicle sectors relate to each other,” huisman said.  with sales rising, it shows that electric cars will become a source of materials such as neodymium, lithium and cobalt in coming years, especially in norway, france, germany, britain and the netherlands which have been early adopters.  last month, another study showed that the world’s electronic scrap in 2016 contained 55 billion euros ($67.29 billion) of valuable materials, most of them squandered because of low recycling rates.  researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million swiss francs ($3.1 million).  still, costs of recycling waste and rapid switches in technology deter investments in urban mining. “what can be very valuable now may not be worth much in a couple of years’ time,” leroy said.  wednesday’s study shows, for instance, how waste copper found in old-fashioned cathode ray screens has been falling across europe since a 2011 peak with the shift to flat screen televisions and computers.  eastern european nations may still be a good place to find such copper because countries in the region have lagged a shift to flat screens which contain other materials such as indium. editing by matthew mpoke bigg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"Martin Williams said: ↑Why is there such a difference between monthly sales and monthly production?At least partly, it's because of Tesla's quarterly production cycle. They pull out the stops at the end of every quarter, maximizing deliveries and putting off needed maintenance so they can run the production line as close to 24/7 as they can. As the deadline approaches, Tesla will concentrate production on those orders which are closest to the Fremont plant, for the shortest delivery time.Then, after they have made every car which can possibly be delivered by the deadline of the end of the month, everybody relaxes, overtime is cancelled, the maintenance which has been put off is performed. Any tweaks which needs to be done to the line over the next quarter are planned. in general, production drops like a rock in the first month of a quarter. Deliveries will be even worse, as Tesla switches from the orders with the shortest delivery times to the ones with the longest of those in the queue. (Not the longest-distance reservations, but the longest distance orders.)Sometime during the first or second month in a quarter, Tesla is likely to pause production for a week (or even two), to make major changes to the Model 3 production line. Let's remember that they're still trying to ramp up production rapidly, so we can expect such down-time as Tesla continues to speed up the Model 3 assembly line. (Contrary to what some have claimed, there is a separate Model 3 production line in the Fremont plant. There may be certain areas where production is shared with the Model S & Model X, but at least parts of the Model 3 production line are physically separated.)Tesla also uses batch processing, making many cars in a row with similar options, paint colors, etc. Since different options require different times for assembly, paint drying, and other factors, switching from one set of options to another may speed up or slow down throughput.All this, taken together, means we should expect that during the first month in a quarter, deliveries will be somewhat lower than production. And it's possible that in the last month of a quarter, deliveries may exceed production, as deliveries come closer to catching up with production than they were in the first two months of that quarter.Last month was, apparently, a ""perfect storm"" of several factors making a surprisingly high disparity between Model 3 production and deliveries. In fact, the disparity was so great that several people commenting on the last month's InsideEVs Monthly Plug-in Sales Scorecard article seriously questioned that IEVs got the number right.See discussion of that particular subject earlier in this very thread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or all three attributes in the same vehicle.  mainstream auto makers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in china, europe and california to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. they also are under pressure from  tesla inc ( tsla.o )’s success in creating electric sedans and suvs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders.  gm said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the united states and china.  gm chief executive mary barra has promised investors the detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021. slideshow (4 images)  volkswagen said in november it would spend $40 billion on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 – significantly more than when it announced two months earlier it would invest more than 20 billion euros on electric and self-driving cars through 2030.  toyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars.  ford’s additional investments in electric vehicles contrasted with many of the vehicle launches at the detroit show which featured trucks and suvs. on sunday evening, daimler ag ( daign.de ) unveiled its new g-class suv, a bulky off roader, in an abandoned movie theater in downtown detroit once used as a set for the movie “8 mile.”  daimler ceo dieter zetsche hinted to former california gov. arnold schwarzenegger during an exchange on stage next to the g-class that daimler would someday have an electric version of the vehicle.  suvs figured in ford’s electric vehicle presentation. the automaker’s president of global markets, jim farley, said on sunday that ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020. the company will begin production of a hybrid version of its popular f-150 truck at a plant in dearborn, michigan, in 2020.  “what we learned from this first cycle of electrification is people want really nice products,” farley said.  ‘think big’  ford’s shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after hackett replaced former chief executive mark fields in may.  the plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. in october, ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to “think big” and “make quicker decisions.”  some of the electric vehicles will be produced with ford’s jv in china aimed at the chinese market. one aim of ford’s “team edison” is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to sherif marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification.  china, india, france and the united kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040. reporting by nick carey and joseph white; additional reporting by david shepardson in detroit; editing by peter cooney and muralikumar anantharaman",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""we're really more looking at the fire aspects,"" ntsb chairman robert sumwalt told reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck. tesla did not immediately comment on the august incident. the ntsb previously said it also is probing an incident in which a tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in california in january. the law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system. ""(our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,"" minami said. while sympathizing with the family, tesla again blamed huang, saying he was well aware that autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged autopilot. tesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned huang several times on the day of the crash to do so. ""the crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if mr. huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,"" a tesla spokesperson told reuters.

""the future is [also] transportation as a service, software as a service."" she added, ""this is where tesla is going."" the highest price target among the wall street analysts who cover tesla is $500 per share. in december , talking up her belief in bitcoin, wood floated another provocative idea, saying the world's biggest cryptocurrency is ""so much bigger an idea than even apple , which is a pretty big idea."" tesla stock at $4,000 would also certainly qualify as big idea, and would translate to a market value about $672 billion.  by comparison, apple already has a market value of about $837 billion, and it's leading the race among google-parent alphabet , microsoft and amazon to become the first $1 trillion company. wood believes tesla, with a current market value of around $56 billion, should be in the same league as the big four tech stocks due to elon musk , the billionaire founder of tesla and spacex. ""if elon musk of spacex can do what they did yesterday in space, they're going to be able to produce the model 3,"" the first mass market electric car from tesla, she said. musk notched a milestone in space on tuesday by successfully launching the most powerful commercial rocket in the world with a tesla roadster sports car on board to demonstrate the kind of payload it can handle. shortly after the launch, musk tweeted out the view of ""starman,"" the crash dummy in the front seat of the roadster, named after the david bowie song. live view of starman  wood said she's confident that tesla can fix the model 3 production problems that have delayed the rollout because the company draws from the ""same brain trust"" as spacex. the ark investment ceo isn't the only money manager with high expectations for musk and tesla. billionaire investor ron baron, a huge shareholder in the electric car company, told cnbc back in november that he believes he can make 20 times his money on the stock over the next 10 to 15 years. morning squawk: cnbc's before the bell news roundup sign up to get morning squawk each weekday job industry advertising/marketing automotive communications/pr construction/manufacturing education finance/banking/insurance legal media/entertainment medical/health care mining/oil/gas/utilities gov't/non-profit real estate retail technology/it transportation/shipping travel/hospitality other get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service. privacy policy . submit please enter a valid email address disclaimer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"may 17, 2018 / 11:33 am / updated 7 hours ago german minister tells carmakers to speed up diesel refits reuters staff 2 min read berlin (reuters) - german environment minister svenja schulze urged carmakers to speed up technical refits of diesel cars to improve air quality after the european commission said on thursday it was taking the country to court for failing to respect air quality limits. svenja schulze, designated german environment minister of the social democratic party (spd) poses during a news conference at the party headquarters in berlin, germany, march 9, 2018. reuters/hannibal hanschke the european commission has decided to take france, germany, hungary, italy, romania and britain to the eu court of justice over the issue. “if we are to survive in court, we need more and faster progress to make the air clean,” schulze said in a statement. “we need (refits for diesel) as soon as possible and at the expense of carmakers as they caused the problem,” she added. german carmaker volkswagen admitted in 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of u.s. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner. the scandal, also known as dieselgate, led to a regulatory crackdown that is threatening thousands of jobs as customers increasingly shun diesel-powered cars. schulze, a member of the center-left social democrats, said the commission’s decision showed that the government had to change it strategy. “to hope that the problem will be solved by itself - as some apparently do - is now no longer an option,” she warned. chancellor angela merkel’s conservatives are more cautious, though, warning that it would not be wise to make the car cover the whole cost of refits as this would weaken their ability to invest in greener technologies. merkel told lawmakers on wednesday that the government had a responsibility to tell the industry that it had to restore trust. but she opposed calls to further increase the burden on carmakers to retrofit vehicles that produce excessive emissions. merkel also called for europe to support the development of the battery and software technologies needed if electric vehicles become the cars of the future, since otherwise europe risks losing its manufacturing abilities to asia and north america. reporting by madeline chambers and michael nienaber; editing by hugh lawson",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"april 12, 2018 / 8:42 pm / a few seconds ago auto industry lawyers warn automated driving hype will be a legal matter tina bellon 6 min read  new york (reuters) - deadly crashes involving tesla inc ( tsla.o ) and uber technologies [uber.ul] vehicles operating entirely or in part under automated systems have made a once-abstract problem very real for auto industry lawyers gathered at a recent conference. a tesla charging station is seen in salt lake city, utah, u.s. september 28, 2017. reuters/lucy nicholson  it is crucial that companies accurately outline limitations of automatic driving systems and the circumstances in which they can and cannot take over steering, braking and lane-keeping, attorneys for the u.s. units of carmakers including hyundai ( 011760.ks ), toyota ( 7203.t ), volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) and supplier company continental ( cong.de ) said at a recent legal conference.  “the oems (carmakers) right now are trying really hard to accurately describe what this equipment can do and can’t do,” said tom vanderford, associate general counsel at hyundai, at a conference last friday in phoenix, arizona attended by reuters.  the american bar association conference took place just a few miles from the scene of a fatal accident involving an uber test vehicle in autonomous mode. the crash cranked up pressure on the self-driving vehicle industry to prove its software and sensors are safe.  on thursday, tesla came under more pressure from regulators and consumer groups for its response to a deadly crash in california of a tesla vehicle operating on autopilot, the name the company uses for an enhanced cruise control system.  fully automated vehicles are not expected to become available to consumers for several years. however, increasingly sophisticated driver assistance features are already sold under various names, carrying disclaimers warning that drivers cannot rely on the systems to safely operate the car in all circumstances.  such technologies include collision avoidance systems that steer the car away from pedestrians. there are also automatic braking systems and audio and visual alerts when cameras, radar or other sensors detect obstacles.  david cades, a human factor scientist at engineering consulting firm exponent, said terminology matters in descriptions of these systems because people might misuse or misunderstand the technology. file photo: the uber logo is seen on a screen in singapore august 4, 2017. reuters/thomas white/file picture  cades, who has testified in automotive cases as an expert witness, said automakers should not use the term “collision avoidance system.” instead, he urged manufacturers to use terms such as “collision mitigation systems.”  “even in naming and marketing these systems care needs to be taken in how they are promoted,” cades said.  john gersch, managing counsel at toyota and another conference participant, pointed to a promotional video shown at the conference, in which tesla ( tsla.o ) touts its autopilot semi-automated system.  “the overreliance issue is probably the most serious issue with all these systems, so that goes with tesla that was shown there,” said gersch.  even though its marketing materials feature the automatic system, tesla’s owners manual tells buyers that they are required to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before activating the system.  the family of a driver killed last month in a tesla car crash has hired law firm minami tamaki llp to explore legal options, the firm said on wednesday, adding the autopilot feature was defective and probably caused his death. tesla in a statement said walter huang, the victim in the california crash, “was well aware that autopilot was not perfect.” tesla added that huang told his family that autopilot “was not reliable in that exact location” of the crash. it said he took his hands off the wheel “several times” before the crash.  investigating a 2016 fatal crash, the national transportation safety board last year said autopilot lacked safeguards, giving too much leeway to the driver to divert attention. the ntsb in a statement on thursday urged tesla to act on the safety recommendations in that report.  following the 2016 accident, tesla introduced more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. after three warnings, the software now blocks autopilot until the driver stops and restarts.  “tesla warns, but in products liability warnings don’t protect you against design defect claims,” said university of south carolina law professor bryant walker smith, who focuses on automated driving.  car accident litigation usually turns on a driver’s alleged negligence. by contrast, a lawsuit involving automated technology could scrutinize whether the system had a design defect.  smith said plaintiffs suing tesla could point to alternative designs, such as general motors co’s ( gm.n ) semi-autonomous super cruise system which tracks eye movement to monitor whether a driver pays attention.  gm says super cruise relies on a pre-defined map and only allows hands-off driving on designated highways and only when the driver is paying attention to the road.  any litigation arising from accidents involving fully or partially automated vehicles could also pit software suppliers against vehicle manufacturers.  industry lawyers said carmakers increasingly indemnify smaller technology companies working on self-driving features.  but tammy fanning, deputy general counsel for parts maker continental, which manufactures radar for blind spot detection systems, told the conference the general automotive liability chain will not change.  “from a product liability perspective it will all stay the same: suppliers will be paying for everything in the end, every recall, all replacements,” fanning said. reporting by tina bellon; editing by david

0,"anchorage, alaska, jan 19 (reuters) - the rebound in the price of crude oil in recent months that has helped producers will be temporary, and the industry must prepare for competition from energy sources elsewhere, the head of the alaska operations of bp plc said at an industry conference on friday. “we might be enjoying prices today that are over $70 a barrel. but when you look at the fundamentals, at bp anyway, we still think lower for even longer. and staying competitive is very important,” janet weiss, president of bp exploration (alaska) inc., said in a speech to the alaska support industry alliance. “when you look at the fundamentals – and you take a look at supply and demand out in time and what is going on with renewables and what is going on with electric cars – and yes, there’s a demand for oil, but there’s a whole lot more of it out there,” she said. “so it’s the low-cost basins that will get to produce. not all the barrels in alaska are going to be produced if we don’t make them competitive.” weiss was not specific in her speech but later told reuters, “definitely not 70s. more the 50s”, referring to oil prices per barrel. while global oil demand is growing, she said, “there’s more oil supply than demand,” along with new non-oil energy. weiss was celebrating bp’s ability to stabilize production at the ageing prudhoe bay field which it operates. average daily production has exceeded 280,000 barrels since 2015, accomplished through operating efficiencies, new technology and extra efforts to wrest new oil from the 40-year-old field, she said in her speech. conocophillips alaska inc. president, joe marushack, avoided any price predictions but said his company is prepared for decreases. “the reason you hear me talk about costs is we’ve got to survive in any price environment,” he told reuters. in his speech, marushack discussed boosting alaska investment. conocophillips this winter is embarking on its biggest north slope exploration season since 2002, with five wells planned, four of them in the national petroleum reserve in alaska (npr-a). the company is expanding its cd5 field in npr-a, which is producing more than 26,000 barrels per day, well above the predicted 16,000 per-day peak, he said. higher prices might have influenced those investments, he told reuters. however, the bigger factor “was us demonstrating that we could get our costs down,” he said. the alaska department of revenue, in budget documents submitted last month, predicted north slope crude prices would average $56 a barrel for the current fiscal year, which ends june 30. the department forecasts slight increases in the price over the coming years, exceeding $60 a barrel after 2020.

1,"frankfurt (reuters) - volkswagen has agreed to raise the wages of around 120,000 workers in germany by 4.3 percent from may, resolving a dispute that had prompted its first strikes since 2004. the deal announced by europe’s largest carmaker and labour union ig metall on wednesday includes a 100-euro one-off payment, improvements to vw’s corporate pension scheme and the right for some workers to choose more time off instead of more money. it also allows for some workers’ hours to be increased temporarily to work on projects, which has been a key demand of industrial employers in recent labour negotiations as they face full order books. ig metall had demanded a 6 percent wage increase for workers at vw’s facilities in western germany, a bump in pensions and more hiring of apprentices to help cope with an industry shift to electric vehicles and self-driving technology. but vw, facing billions of euros in costs and fines over its diesel emissions-test cheating scandal and huge investments for its subsequent transformation plan, had dismissed the demands as excessive. it had offered to raise wages by 3.5 percent and by a further 2 percent over 30 months. volkswagen's logos are pictured at the 45th tokyo motor show in tokyo, japan october 25, 2017. reuters/kim kyung-hoon/files the 4.3 percent wage increase now agreed for a 27-month period mirrors a deal that ig metall won for around 3.9 million industrial employees in germany this month after rolling 24-hour strikes across the country. “this (similarity) was an important objective for us in order to safeguard the competitiveness of volkswagen,” board member karlheinz blessing said in a statement. “at the same time, we have made volkswagen significantly more attractive as an employer,” he said. vw workers will also receive an additional payment equivalent to 27.5 percent of their monthly wage once a year from next year. some employees with small children at home or who work a demanding shift schedule can choose to take six additional days off instead, the parties said. on the other hand, volkswagen will be able to ask five percent and in special cases even 10 percent of the workers covered by the wage agreement to temporarily increase their working hours to up to 40 per week. “this provision gives us the additional flexibility which we definitely needed,” vw chief negotiator martin rosik said. from july 2019, the amount that volkswagen pays into the company pension scheme each month will rise to 90 euros per member from 27 euros now, and increase to 98 euros from january 2020. reporting by maria sheahan; editing by keith weir and jason neely",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""we have a great deal of skepticism about the targets that they put out,"" said colin rusch, managing director and senior research analyst at oppenheimer & co . while he said the 2,000-plus vehicles tesla produced last week was a ""great accomplishment,"" he said he doesn't ""see any reason to suggest that they're out of the woods either."" rusch said some of the challenges that lay ahead for the company are cell production for battery packs and automation for the model 3 assembly. ""even if they're able to cobble together a couple of good weeks, that doesn't mean that the sustainable run rate will continue,"" rusch said. the company built 34,494 vehicles during 2018's first quarter — 9,766 of which were model 3s. first-quarter deliveries of the three tesla models also set a record with 29,980 vehicles — 11,730 were the model s, 10,070 were the model x, and 8,180 were the model 3. still, march was the second-worst-performing month for tesla shares — down 36 percent since the september 2017 record high of $389.61.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"january 5, 2018 / 7:12 am / in 4 hours investors sense opportunities in big oil - but mind the gap helen reid , ron bousso 8 min read  london (reuters) - investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks.  while shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes.  uncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector.  but a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies’ profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks.  “2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,” said olivia markham, portfolio manager at blackrock commodities income investment trust. she expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years.  ubs, rbc and jp morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while barclays analysts predicted on thursday that earnings for the european integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter.  optimists point to developments like shell’s ( rdsa.l ) raising in november of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel.  “annus mirabilis. highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,” bernstein said in its outlook for european oil majors.  figures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. the msci world energy index .dmiwo0en00pus, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though brent crude hit 2-1/2 year highs. europe’s oil and gas sector.sxep, which includes shell, total ( totf.pa ), bp ( bp.l ) and eni ( eni.mi ), was the worst-performing in the region. little conviction  oil majors’ shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. since june, the msci index has gained 20 percent but brent lcoc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after opec and other major producers agreed to cut output.  the majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump.  with production from u.s. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels.  “there’s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. everyone is waiting to understand what’s going on,” said angelo meda, head of equities at italian fund manager banor sim.  as well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters.  whether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again.  “from here it’s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn’t help you out,” said peter hackworth, oil equity analyst at goldman sachs.  as well as the strong cash flow generation at the european majors, early signs of capital discipline among u.s. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year.  goldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the brent price. scrapping the scrip  one crucial component in winning back investors’ confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share.  shell and bp have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. goldman sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months.  average dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, hackworth said.  but not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue.  “the market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. so i think the market is overreacting,” said eric moore, european income fund manager at miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year.  moore’s fund holds bp, shell, statoil ( stl.ol ), eni and premier oil. ( pmo.l )  analysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since october after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump – could also boost the sector. peak demand?  investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets.  “electric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,” blackrock’s markham said.  some are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays.  but the shift to cleaner energy doesn’t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables.  nick davis, european income fund manager at polar capital, said he prefers total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power.  but in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said.  evercore isi analyst doug terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. for him, bp, shell, chevron ( cvx.n ) and conocophillips ( cop.n ) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note.  “the historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. it failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.”  graphic - oil prices and energy shares: here reporting by helen reid and ron bousso, editing by dmitry zhdannikov and david stamp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"as recently as 2013, the phrase “self-driving car” was nowhere to be found in documents published by the u.s. department of transportation. oh, what a difference half a decade makes. less than five years after the term first appeared in a 14-page memo produced by the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa), the u.s. house and senate commerce committee unanimously passed two separate bills regulating self-driving cars. the u.s. department of transportation is presently working on a third revision of the federal automated vehicle policy it first released in september, 2016. each january is simultaneously exciting and maddening for transportation wonks of all stripes. in the space of three weeks, four major conferences converge to produce a barrage of flashy demos at the consumer electronics show, new vehicles at the north american international auto show (naias) in detroit, academic research at the transportation research board annual meeting and glimmers of forthcoming policies at the sae government/industry meeting . automated vehicles also made their way into discussions at this week’s world economic forum meeting in davos, where uber ceo dara khosrowshahi tried to dispel concerns that driving jobs would evaporate. as self-driving cars began to appear on the roads in 2009, developers were quick to point at regulators as the roadblock that would prevent their widespread deployment: regulations would be too slow, too restrictive, or a “patchwork” of regulations across states would hamper any broad deployment. these fears have thus far proved to be unfounded. although nhtsa’s first federal automated vehicle policy was strictly voluntary, by the time the 2017 revision was released a year later, the policy had shrunk from 112 to a mere 26 pages. nhtsa eliminated entire sections, and in other areas simply replaced the words “should” with “are encouraged to” as if to reassure skittish automated vehicle engineers — and lawyers — everywhere that, no, these really aren’t regulations. nhtsa’s existing policies aren’t binding, so there’s not much stick to be worried about. still, the new house and senate legislation ( self-drive and av-start ) approved in october, 2017 provide some powerful additional carrots: preemption of any state regulation of the design, construction, or performance of vehicles, and potential exemption of tens of thousands of vehicles per year from existing safety regulations. automotive manufacturers and technology companies are slowly beginning to release technical details in response to nhtsa’s softly-worded requests. last october, waymo released its safety report, intel / mobileye released its “plan to develop safe autonomous vehicles. and prove it” and this month gm / cruise released a report of its own. to varying degrees, these reports attempt to address issues of risk, the causes of errors or accidents, and responsibility. questions of responsibility and fault have also begun to arise in the small number of accidents involving partially- and fully-automated vehicles to-date. in the most serious of these, a fatal accident involving a tesla model s in may, 2016, both nhtsa and the national transportation safety board (ntsb) conducted independent investigations of the accident. these agencies each approached the accident with slightly different objectives.. for nhtsa, the objective is to answer the question “was a safety-related defect identified?” nhtsa’s investigation found no such defect. the ntsb’s mission in crash investigations is slightly different: to objectively determine the facts of the accident and to identify probable causes. the ntsb’s investigation found plenty of fault to go around: “the probable cause of the williston, florida, crash was the truck driver’s failure to yield the right of way to the car, combined with the car driver’s inattention due to overreliance on vehicle automation, which resulted in the car driver’s lack of reaction to the presence of the truck.” the ntsb also noted that the design of the driver assistance systems on the tesla permitted prolonged disengagement by the driver. uber ceo dara khosrowshahi at the world economic forum (wef) annual meeting in davos, switzerland, january 23, 2018. reuters/denis balibouse in the context of this accident and others, i’ve found myself taking a more personal look at the issue. last july, i was walking through a parking lot to drop my children off at summer camp when my 5-year-old-son suddenly jumped and ran — he saw a spider and was playfully overreacting. i always keep the children farthest away from the traffic lanes, but in a matter of a second or two he ran behind me and about 15 feet straight into the path of a car on its way out of the parking lot. i leaned back to try to intercept him but he was out of my reach, and the best i could do was step out into traffic together with him and gesticulate at the driver. fortunately the driver was (a) not traveling quickly, and (b) paying close attention to the task, or that morning might have had a very different ending. it was the next moment that got me thinking. as the driver stopped i nodded and mouthed “thank you” to her. she smiled in return, in what i interpreted as an indication that my son’s actions were innocent but that she had protected him. children pass by a self-driving chevy bolt ev car in san francisco, november 28, 2017. reuters/elijah nouvelage fundamentally, what struck me is the degree to which driving involves compensating for the mistakes of others. had there been an accident that day, my son (and i) would have been at “fault” to the degree it could be assigned. however, assigning fault isn’t always the point — i like to think that had the situation been reversed, i would have also been driving carefully and taken similar evasive action. i can’t think of another common situation in life in which we frequently make potentially fatal mistakes and depend on others to notice and compensate for them. this is a profound form of a social contract, and a shift to self-driving vehicles would be a fundamental movement away from this idea, towards one where we expect vehicles to make fewer mistakes. i’m less confident that they’ll be able to fulfill the same role in compensating for the mistakes of others. this social contract of driving is one that overarches questions that might be asked by nhtsa (e.g. “did this system fail or act as intended?”) or the ntsb (e.g. “is the system driving this vehicle at fault?”) as a society a third, related question that we could ask is that of the counterfactual: “had a human been operating this vehicle would the accident have happened?” this question captures the fact that we compensate for the failures and inattention of others nearly every time we drive. at the same time, we’ll need to begin to ask the reverse question of each human failing: “had a computer been at the wheel, would the accident have happened?” the challenge that we’ll face in answering these questions lies in the fundamental problem of causal inference : we can’t simultaneously examine two different conditions in the same accident. another challenge we’ll face will be our inability to internalize the causes of accidents. human-caused accidents are often terrible, but at some level we can usually empathize with a driver who fell asleep, drove too fast or looked down at the wrong moment. computer systems have fundamentally different strengths and weaknesses than humans do, and some of the accidents of the future will be hard to comprehend. as we begin to accumulate statistics on accidents involving self-driving cars, they will occur for reasons we may be able to explain technically but cannot envision doing ourselves. accepting this change will involve a new social contract: rather than depending on other drivers to compensate for our mistakes, we’ll depend on engineers to make fewer of them. about the

chinese carmaker geely has built up an almost 10 percent stake in daimler ( daign.de ) in a $9 billion (£6.44 billion) bet by its chairman that he can access the mercedes-benz owner’s technology in the growing battle for the future of automotives. the purchase by li shufu, geely’s founder and main owner, means china’s largest privately-owned automaker is now the biggest shareholder in germany’s daimler. geely said on saturday there were no plans “for the time being” to raise the stake further. instead, it will seek to forge an alliance with daimler, which is developing electric and self-driving vehicles, to respond to the challenge from new competitors such as tesla ( tsla.o ), google ( googl.o ) and uber. “no current car industry player is likely to win this battle against the invaders from outside without friends. to achieve and assert technological leadership, one has to adapt a new way of thinking in terms of sharing and combining strength. my investment in daimler reflects this vision,” li said. “daimler is pleased to announce that with li shufu it could win another long-term orientated shareholder, which is convinced by daimler’s innovation strength, strategy and future potential,” the german company said in a statement. geely officials plan to travel to stuttgart to meet daimler executives early next week and also hope to meet top german government officials in berlin, two sources familiar with the matter told reuters. the chinese firm plans to use the meetings to underline that it intends to be a supportive long-term investor, they said. daimler had no immediate comment on any meetings. geely and the german economy ministry declined to comment. chinese investors in german technology companies have tended to take a consensual approach, buying incremental stakes in companies such as robotics firms kuka and kion, typically after long consultation with management and other stakeholders. in november, geely asked daimler to issue new shares so it could buy a stake, as a way to access mercedes-benz technology for electric cars and trucks, including battery technology, to help geely comply with a chinese crackdown on pollution. but the german company turned down the offer saying it did not want to dilute existing shareholders, sources at the time told reuters. li changed tactics, and quietly amassed a stake of 9.69 percent worth $9 billion at daimler’s current share price. the sources said former morgan stanley ( ms.n ) germany ceo dirk notheis was the architect of amassing the daimler stake, working with former morgan stanley china executive yi bao. notheis declined to comment, while bao was not reachable. file photo: a sign is seen on a vehicle displayed at geely auto's booth during the auto china 2016 auto show in beijing, china, april 29, 2016. reuters/damir sagolj/file photo german state secretary at the economy ministry, matthias machnig, said separately that eu trade ministers meeting next week in sofia would discuss how better to protect strategically important european companies from unwanted investors. “it is important that europe keeps a close eye on which key european technologies foreign strategic investors are setting their sights on,” he said. machnig did not comment specifically on daimler. expansion drive only two or three auto manufacturers will likely survive, a source familiar with li’s thinking told reuters, prompting geely to seek access to carmakers with a technological edge. daimler is also the only one of germany’s three carmakers not to be controlled by a family. volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) is majority-owned by the porsche-piech clan, while bmw ( bmwg.de ) is 47 percent owned by susanne klatten, germany’s richest woman, and her brother stefan quandt. geely’s move poses a challenge to the german carmaker, since mercedes-benz already has an industrial alliance to develop cars and trucks with renault-nissan ( rena.pa ), which owns a 3.1 percent stake in daimler, and has announced plans to build electric cars with existing chinese joint-venture partner baic motor corporation ( 1958.hk ). bernstein research analyst max warburton said: “it’s not clear what geely wants and how it’s going to work, but we view this move as part of a broader chinese move to gain involvement in the european automotive industry.” “china wants a payback after spending a decade gifting the european auto industry super-normal growth and profits. now it wants more direct access to technology, brands and profits,” he wrote in a note shortly after the stake was disclosed. zhejiang geely holding owns volvo cars, levc, the maker of london’s black cabs, and last year took a majority stake in sports car maker lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in malaysian automaker proton, a $3.3 billion stake in volvo trucks and control of flying car start-up terrafugia. “not seeking control” geely sees potential in daimler because it is developing high-speed connectivity for autonomous cars at a time when li believes satellite-based internet connections could become more important, the source familiar with his thinking said. the source said daimler and geely had not held concrete talks about how to structure a potential joint venture, adding: “you know we have to become a stakeholder in order to engage.” swedish truck maker ab volvo, one of geely’s other investments, has objected to the chinese firm’s stake-building in daimler, citing anti-trust concerns, the source added. “we will protect interests of both companies by abiding laws in the country and the company’s governance structure. we are not seeking to have a controlling power in daimler,” the source added. additional reporting by douglas busvine in frankfurt, jan schwartz in hamburg, ankit ajmera in

0,"(repeats from friday; no changes to text) by giancarlo navach milan, april 13 (reuters) - italian energy group eni is considering stepping up its investment in nuclear fusion, potentially doubling down on a technology considered so uncertain that eni remains the only global oil company prepared to place a bet on it. eni and bigger rivals such as shell and bp have been looking at moving into renewable energy as climate change, the falling cost of solar and wind power and a shift to electric vehicles raise doubts over long-term demand for oil. eni last month committed 50 million euros ($62 million) to one of several projects aiming to produce energy by fusing atoms at temperatures as hot as the sun, a process seen by doubters as still closer to science fiction than commercial reality. after the move, eni’s head of development operations and technology, roberto casula, said it might raise its investment in commonwealth fusion system, a firm created by the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), which is developing the project. “after the transition to renewable energy, the real breakthrough technologically is nuclear fusion,” casula said, adding the process involved recreating the physics of the sun, producing heat but no emissions and very limited nuclear waste. casula estimates it will cost $3 billion to develop a 200-megawatt fusion reactor by 2033 and says commonwealth fusion system is looking to raise more funds and to draw up an overall investment agreement with a range of financiers. casula and mit declined to give the size of eni’s current stake, and the eni executive could not say at this stage how much it would be ready to invest. he said eni had signed a deal giving it the right to use the project’s intellectual property. “the eventual stake we’ll have in the company will be decided when there is an overall investment agreement, depending also on how much they will raise,” casula said. the mit project is vying with research teams in france, china and britain to develop a reactor that can generate more energy than the enormous amount that fusion consumes, and can also safely contain a mass of super-hot gases or plasma. italy also recently entered the race, though eni is sticking with mit, saying the boston project is unique in its aim to produce electricity, while others have scientific objectives. all projects are based on a system known as tokamak, which uses superconducting magnets to hold the plasma at temperatures of up to 100 million degrees, suspending it inside a vacuum chamber without it touching the chamber’s walls. to make electricity, heat produced by the fusion of hydrogen isotopes is used to spin steam turbines in the conventional way. overly ambitious? the france-based iter project is the largest endeavour, with a budget of around 20 billion euros. a collaboration between europe, the united states, china, india, japan, russia and south korea, it is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035. unlike the mit project, the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (iter) team does not plan to generate electricity, saying this will be further in the future, and is being supported by governments rather than the private sector. “based on our experience with the iter project, we feel the mit timeline to a power plant in 15 years is very ambitious, if not overly ambitious,” iter chief scientist tim luce said. “but if they succeed, we will celebrate their success.” iter director bernard bigot said nuclear fusion research and development were being driven mainly by governments, likening it to the early days of space technology and suggesting the time had yet to arrive when private investors would take the lead. “in fusion research we are only about in the 1960s, before anybody got to the moon,” bigot said. mit and eni are more optimistic. the boston-based team, which has built a bedroom-sized experimental tokamak reactor, plans to develop a larger-scale system of superconducting magnets within three years and build a fusion reactor within eight before finally, within 15 years, completing a nuclear-fusion power plant generating electricity. “our goal is to do things even faster than that because it is a unique opportunity right now and with climate change we should be aggressive and ambitious,” said bob mumgaard, chief executive of mit project company commonwealth fusion system. he said the mit and iter projects differed mainly in their magnet technologies, and that mit’s system enabled it to contain plasma in a smaller chamber. “in fusion devices the magnetic field is very important and this will allow us to build a device which is one sixtieth the volume of iter,” mumgaard said, adding that mit’s final-stage reactor would be the size of a basketball court. though research into nuclear fusion dates to the 1950s, some scientists doubt the technology can become a commercial energy source within mit’s 15-year timeframe. “the ability to make these components work in the desired way in the presence of such intense fields of irradiation ... is a very big challenge,” said matteo passoni, a nuclear engineer and expert on plasma physics at milan’s polytechnic university. for eni, though, its investment in fusion represents a modest bet on a potentially big discovery, a familiar equation to its upstream division when it explores for oil and gas. “arriving within 15-16 years at a commercial reactor is exactly the timeframe we use in upstream,” casula said.

0,"eight months after taking over as chief executive of ford motor , jim hackett is still trying to accomplish one of his most important tasks: convincing wall street that he has a compelling plan to reinvigorate the automaker. mr. hackett, 62, a former chief executive of the office-furniture supplier steelcase , has taken several shots at it. in october, he and the new team of top executives he selected appeared before financial analysts in new york to outline a plan to cut costs — improve ford's ""fitness,"" in mr. hackett's words — and to accelerate development of trucks, electric cars and self-driving vehicles. he pressed his case further this month before large audiences at the consumer electronics show in las vegas and the detroit auto show. but so far investors and analysts remain uninspired. the company's stock is virtually unchanged since late september, while the standard & poor's 500-stock index has gained 13 percent. read more from the new york times: salaried or hourly? the gaps in family-friendly policies begin to close why strong growth is a headache for the european central bank about that joint: marijuana start-ups pass ""ford is basically saying, 'we have a lot of inefficiencies, and it's going to take a lot of time to fix,'"" said david whiston, a financial analyst at morningstar. ""i thought a lot of these inefficiencies were taken care of a long time ago. it's disappointing."" the latest disappointment arrived on wednesday, when ford reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents a share. that was an improvement over a loss in the comparable period a year ago, but its adjusted earnings were 39 cents a share, about 4 cents less than analysts expected. profit fell in north america as sales slowed in the united states, and the company lost about $200 million in the rest of the world. sales in china fell 6 percent. the company forecast a decline in earnings this year, mainly as a result of rising commodity costs and unfavorable exchange rates. ford also said it would have higher costs related to the introduction of new models — 23 are coming this year globally, compared with 11 in 2017. ""we need to be fitter,"" said ford's chief financial officer, robert l. shanks. mr. shanks told reporters that he didn't think analysts were unconvinced about ford's turnaround plan. ""with the exception of tesla , the market is skeptical about the sector's ability to be successful in the world that's ahead of us"" he said. in a conference call, analysts pressed mr. hackett to talk about initiatives to improve profitability, but he declined to discuss them in detail, except to say they are ""up and running."" just a few years ago, ford was considered the healthiest of the three detroit automakers, having escaped the government-engineered bankruptcies that engulfed general motors and chrysler . with alan mulally as chief executive, ford slimmed down, focused on its ford and lincoln brands, and roared to record profits. after mr. mulally retired in 2014 and passed the baton to mark fields, however, ford began to drift as new technologies started reshaping the industry; as new challengers emerged in tesla, google and uber; and as a revived g.m. and a merged fiat chrysler automobiles provided increased competition in the high-margin business of trucks and roomy sport-utility vehicles. its stock slumped, and ford directors began wondering if mr. fields had the right strategy. in may, ford's board ousted mr. fields and called on mr. hackett, who had previously served on the board and then joined the company to run its activities in autonomous vehicles and related efforts. mr. hackett took three months to dive into ford's troubles and found that ford was spending too much time and money developing new vehicles, and that costs for steel, other materials and components were rising. his prescription called for ford to refocus investments on growing markets like china and highly profitable vehicles like trucks and s.u.v.s, while cutting back on initiatives in less promising areas like europe and passenger cars. ""we are intensely focusing on fixing the fundamental health of our company,"" mr. hackett said on wednesday. to ensure that ford will be a player down the road, the company is also ramping up plans to introduce 40 electrified vehicles by 2022 and a driverless car for taxi fleets, ride-hailing services and delivery companies by 2021. at the detroit show, ford said it planned to spend $11 billion on electric vehicles by 2022. but neither the plan nor mr. hackett himself has generated much excitement. his appearance in las vegas, where mr. mulally shined in the past, fell flat. at a conference known for gee-whiz demonstrations of new technologies, mr. hackett gave a presentation about how to rethink transportation and cities of the future. ""it was very philosophical,"" said mr. whiston, who was in the audience. ""he might be appealing to a nonautomotive audience, but financial analysts want more."" more troubling to wall street is that ford's new strategy is likely to have little immediate impact on its bottom line. brian johnson, a financial analyst at barclays , wrote in a note to clients issued before ford reported its fourth-quarter results that ""the path ahead in shifting ford's strategy will be rather long."" g.m. has been ahead of ford in adding trucks and s.u.v.s to its lineup. at the detroit show, ford unveiled a midsize pickup truck, the ranger. g.m.'s chevrolet and gmc brands have had midsize trucks for nearly three years. ""there was a really stark contrast between ford and g.m. presentations"" given to financial analysts at the show, mr. whiston said.

which along with jeep and maserati was the focus of the last strategy launched in 2014 - has yet to turn a profit. the market ridiculed marchionne’s forecast for eight new alfa romeos and 400,000 annual sales by 2018. only two models have hit the road so far as focus shifted to fixing fca’s finances. but investors take reassurance from what marchionne achieved in north america, which now makes three-fourths of profits. fca retooled some u.s. plants to boost output of lucrative suvs and trucks, while ending production of unprofitable sedans. the move got fca close to erasing the margin gap with its larger u.s. rivals and set it on course to erase debt this year. marchionne has set in motion a similar shift in europe, where italian plants are being revamped to produce alfas, jeeps and maseratis, while output of some fiats is being shifted to lower-cost locations elsewhere or discontinued. this should boost profitability and prevent layoffs that would have been difficult to justify in italy particularly with populist political parties in the driving seat. marchionne multiplied fiat’s value 11 times since he took charge in june 2004, including by spinning off tractor firm cnh industrial ( cnhi.mi ) and supercar brand ferrari ( race.mi ). the pending spin-off of parts maker magneti marelli will further up the figure, raising expectations of more deals to come. marchionne has ruled out separating the jeep brand, saying he had to worry “about the stump that’s left behind”. he also poured cold water on the idea of a maserati or alfa spin-off, saying the two needed to become self-sustainable first. but the doubling in fca’s stock in the last 12 months suggests many still bet on marchionne doing a final major rejig before he hands over to an internal successor next year. “partnerships, a merger, spin-offs and other value accretive deals make up more than 40 percent of the fca investment case,” said michele pedroni, a fund manager at decalia asset management. fca declined comment on friday’s presentation. joe white in detroit; editing by david holmes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"17 hours ago | 02:19 in cities all over the u.s., electric vehicles have been popping up from companies like limebike, spin, bird and uber's jump bikes. these start-ups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to solve what some call the last mile transportation problem — the symbolic distance between public transit and the final destination. while consumers may be excited about this influx of new vehicles hitting the road, cities aren't quite ready for them yet. here's how they work: first, you use an app on your phone to find a scooter or bike you want to rent. then walk to it on the street. you unlock it by scanning a qr code on the handle and then you're off. there's a brake on one side and a throttle on the other that'll propel you up to 15 miles per hour. in downtown san francisco , the number of electric scooters has surged recently, introducing a host of problems, including people illegally riding on sidewalks, vandalization and parked scooters blocking the walkways. the city even began impounding scooters that are parked illegally. bloomberg | getty images aaron peskin, an elected official from san francisco's board of supervisors has been swamped with thousands of complaints from frustrated residents, including some who have actually been injured by a scooter. the city's laws require electric scooter operators to not ride on the sidewalk and to wear a helmet, but looking around this city you'll notice that barely anyone is following these rules. ""i don't want these folks ending up in my hospital at the taxpayers' expense,"" peskin said. ""i want our sidewalks to be safe."" san francisco will soon start seeing fewer scooters on the road. a new permit process will begin limiting the number of scooters to just 1,250 for the entire city and require companies to register them with the municipal transit authority. but executives at these companies say this is just the beginning. ben bear a vp at spin told cnbc that ""consumer demand will win out in the long run.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"february 13, 2018 / 2:33 pm / in 7 hours daimler warns of supply chain risk from switch to electric cars reuters staff 4 min read frankfurt (reuters) - daimler ag, owner of the mercedes-benz brand, warned that a fall in demand for diesel cars and a switch to electric vehicles could force it to prop up its supplier base. carmakers face increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over pollution levels produced by their diesel-engined vehicles after volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) in 2015 admitted to cheating emission tests using engine management software. to avoid a total ban on their diesel vehicles, daimler and other carmakers have stepped up development of electric cars and agreed to update their engine management software to cut down pollution levels. daimler’s suppliers are being forced to invest to help electrify the entire mercedes-benz range by 2022, prompting the carmaker to use unusually frank language to warn about the impact of the shift to electrified cars in its report. “due to the planned electrification of new model series and a shift in customer demand from diesel to gasoline engines, the mercedes-benz cars segment in particular is faced with the risk that daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers,” the carmaker said in its annual report. “this could result in over- or under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers. if suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,” daimler said. “necessary capacity expansion at suppliers’ plants could also require cost-effective participation,” daimler added. daimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing daimler to step in. daimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. in its annual report, daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices. “generally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,” the annual report said. daimler’s report, published on tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier. the stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings. daimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined mercedes-benz vehicles in the united states in a class-action suit which alleges the german carmaker used software to reduce emissions. daimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed. among the legal risks faced by daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities. daimler also said in its report that chief executive dieter zetsche’s total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier.

0,"salt lake city (ap) — a tesla that crashed while in autopilot mode in utah this month accelerated in the seconds before it smashed into a stopped firetruck, according to a police report obtained by the associated press. two people were injured. data from the model s electric vehicle show it picked up speed for 3.5 seconds before crashing into the firetruck in suburban salt lake city, the report said. the driver manually hit the brakes a fraction of a second before impact. police suggested that the car was following another vehicle and dropped its speed to 55 mph (89 kph) to match the leading vehicle. they say the leading vehicle then likely changed lanes and the tesla automatically sped up to its preset speed of 60 mph (97 kph) without noticing the stopped cars ahead. the police report, which was obtained thursday through an open records request, provides detail about the vehicle's actions immediately before the may 11 crash and the driver's familiarity with its system. the driver of the vehicle, heather lommatzsch, 29, told police she thought the vehicle's automatic emergency braking system would detect traffic and stop before the car hit another vehicle. she said she owned the car for two years and used the semi-autonomous autopilot feature on all kinds of roadways, including the utah highway where she crashed, according to the report. lommatzsch said the car did not provide any audio or visual warnings before the crash. a witness told police she did not see signs the car illuminate its brake lights or swerve to avoid the truck ahead of it. lommatzsch did not return a voicemail message on thursday. a tesla spokeswoman, keely sulprizio, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. the car company has said it repeatedly warns drivers to stay alert, keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicle at all times while using the autopilot system. police say car data show lommatzsch did not touch the steering wheel for 80 seconds before the crash. she told police she was looking at her phone and comparing different routes to her destination. she broke her foot in the crash and this week was charged with a misdemeanor traffic citation. online court records do not show an attorney listed for her. the driver of the firetruck told police he had injuries consistent with whiplash but did not go to a hospital. tesla's autopilot system uses cameras, ultrasonic sensors and radar to sense the vehicle's surrounding environment and perform basic functions automatically. among those functions is automatic emergency braking, which the company says on its website is designed ""to detect objects that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly."" tesla says the system is not designed to avoid a collision and warns drivers not to rely on it entirely. the national highway traffic safety administration has said it is investigating the may 11 crash. tesla reached a settlement agreement in a federal lawsuit alleging that it sold autopilot features that weren't available and made its vehicles dangerous, according to court records released thursday by the u.s. district court in san jose. neither tesla nor seattle attorney steve berman, who represented the plaintiffs, would comment friday. but tesla said previously that since rolling out its second generation of autopilot, it has continued to update software leading to major improvements. the company has said that it agreed to compensate customers who purchased autopilot and had to wait longer than expected to get all of its features. tesla's autopilot has been the subject of previous scrutiny following other crashes involving the vehicles. in march, a driver was killed when a model x with autopilot engaged hit a barrier while traveling at ""freeway speed"" in california. nhtsa and the national transportation safety board are investigating that case. this week, tesla said autopilot was not engaged when a model s veered off a road and plunged into a pond outside san francisco, killing the driver. earlier in may, the ntsb opened a probe into an accident in which a model s caught fire after crashing into a wall at a high speed in florida. two 18-year-olds were trapped and died in the blaze. the agency has said it does not expect autopilot to be a focus in that investigation. ap auto writer tom krisher contributed to this story from detroit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""the daimler workforce has once again succeeded in breaking the records set in the previous year,"" said dieter zetsche, chairman of the board of management of daimler ag and head of mercedes-benz cars . ""our company stands for stable success in volatile times. but: stability is no justification for still stand. that's why we are pushing forward with the transformation in all areas at daimler."" the daimler group achieved ebit of €14.7 billion in 2017 (2016: €12.9 billion), which surpassed the prior-year figure significantly. net profit increased to a new record of €10.9 billion (2016: €8.8 billion). earnings per share increased accordingly to €9.84 (2016: €7.97). daimler increased its total unit sales in the year 2017 by 9% to 3.3 million vehicles, thus surpassing its growth target. the mercedes-benz cars and mercedes-benz vans divisions exceeded the forecasts made at the beginning of the year by recording significant growth (8% and 12% respectively). daimler trucks also posted a significant increase of 13% in unit sales. at the beginning of the year, the division had anticipated unit sales similar to those of the previous year. the sales forecast was successively adjusted as a result of more favorable market developments in some important markets. unit sales at daimler buses were also significantly higher than in the prior year (+9%). the development of earnings reflects primarily the very good situation of unit sales in the automotive segments. accordingly, the mercedes-benz cars division increased its earnings due in particular to further growth in unit sales, especially of the suv models and the new e-class. daimler trucks also significantly improved its earnings compared with the previous year, mainly due to increased unit sales in the nafta region and the sale of real estate in japan. mercedes-benz vans and daimler buses achieved ebit at the prior-year level. ebit at daimler financial services increased significantly. exchange-rate effects had a net positive impact on operating profit. ""we have continued our trend of profitable growth and once again set new records for unit sales, revenue and earnings. in addition, we have further increased the funding of our pension plans with a contribution of €3 billion,"" said bodo uebber, member of the board of management of daimler ag responsible for finance & controlling and daimler financial services . ""we have strengthened our core business and created an excellent starting position to master the challenges of the fundamental transformation of the automotive industry that lie ahead of us."" the board of management and the supervisory board will propose to the annual shareholders' meeting to be held on april 5, 2018 that the dividend per share for the 2017 financial year be increased to €3.65 (prior year: €3.25). the dividend distribution will thus increase to the record level of €3.9 billion (2016: €3.5 billion). ""we are proud of the best year in the company's history. we want our shareholders to participate in this success and are proposing the biggest dividend in the company's history,"" said uebber. the net liquidity of the industrial business decreased to €16.6 billion at the end of 2017 (2016: €19.7 billion). this decrease is almost entirely explained by an extraordinary contribution of €3 billion to the german pension plan assets of daimler ag. for the same reason, the free cash flow of the industrial business decreased to €2.0 billion (2016: €3.9 billion). without this effect, the free cash flow of the industrial business would have been €5.0 billion and thus higher than in the previous year and higher than the dividend distribution in the year 2017, despite a significant increase in advance expenditure for new products and technologies. in line with the ongoing high level of earnings, daimler continues to have very sound key financial metrics. this was confirmed by the rating agencies in their publications during the year. in early february 2017, moody's raised daimler's long-term credit rating from a3 to a2 and the short-term rating from p-2 to p-1. and in november 2017, the canadian rating agency dbrs also raised the long-term rating from a (low) to a. slight workforce growth as expected at december 31, 2017, the daimler group employed a total of 289,321 men and women, which represents an increase of 2% (2016: 282,488). the main reason for the growth was the good business situation worldwide. the number of employees in germany increased to 172,089 (2016: 170,034). at the end of 2017, the group had a total of 8,097 apprentices and trainees (2016: 7,960). in 2017, 1,278 young people began their vocational training at daimler ag (2016: 1,662), and 1,197 were hired after completing their training (2016: 1,448). daimler works continuously on consolidating and enhancing its attractiveness as a modern employer – with both employees and job applicants. the employees can take advantage of mobile work, are supported in combining a career with family life, have comprehensive possibilities for training and further training, a broad spectrum of health-care management, competitive remuneration and add-on benefits in line with the market such as a company pension. in addition, the company lets the employees participate in the company's financial success. in april 2018, daimler ag will pay its eligible employees an amount of up to €5,700 for financial year 2017 (2016: €5,400). details of the divisions ""in 2017, mercedes-benz not only sold more cars than our direct competitors, we also grew faster: by 10% in retail terms,"" said dieter zetsche. ""in other words, we have further extended our leadership in the premium segment."" the mercedes-benz cars division consists of the mercedes-benz brand with the mercedes-amg, mercedes-maybach and mercedes me sub-brands, as well as the smart brand and the new eq brand for electric mobility. the division continued on its course of profitable growth in the year under review, with unit sales increasing by 8% to the new record level of 2,373,500 vehicles and revenue rising by 6% to €94.7 billion. mercedes-benz cars was also able to improve its market position in nearly all regions. the division's ebit in 2017 of €9,207 million was significantly higher than the prior-year result of €8,112 million and its return on sales was 9.7% (2016: 9.1%). the positive earnings development primarily reflects the increased unit sales of new vehicles. the main drivers were the suv segment and the new e-class. additional positive effects on ebit resulted from exchange-rate effects and income of €183 million in connection with the remeasurement of the investment in there holding b.v., using the at-equity method. negative effects resulted from advance expenditure for new technologies and future vehicles and from expenses for the expansion of production capacities. higher expenses for raw materials also had a negative impact on ebit. furthermore, expenses for voluntary service activities and expenses for a specific vehicle recall (€425 million) had a significant impact on earnings. in the year 2016, ebit included expenses in connection with takata airbags (€480 million) and expenses in connection with the remeasurement of inventories (€238 million). daimler trucks significantly increased its unit sales to the number of 470,700 vehicles in 2017 (2016: 415,100). revenue of €35.7 billion was also significantly higher than in the previous year (2016: €33.2 billion). the division's ebit in 2017 of €2,380 million was 22% higher than in the prior-year figure of €1,948 million. the return on sales was 6.7% (2016: 5.9%). the positive development of earnings was primarily the result of increased unit sales in the nafta region. ebit was also boosted by income from the sale of real estate at the kawasaki site in japan (€267 million) and by efficiency improvements. higher expenses for raw materials and expenses of €172 million for the fixed-cost optimization had a negative impact on ebit. mercedes-benz vans set a new unit sales record once again in financial year 2017, with an increase of 12% to 401,000 vehicles. at €13.2 billion, revenue was also higher than in the previous year (2016: €12.8 billion). the division achieved ebit in 2017 of €1,181 million, similar to the prior-year level (2016: €1,170 million). its return on sales was 9.0% (2016: 9.1%). ebit was affected by higher expenses for product ramp-ups and new technologies. furthermore, earnings were reduced by the termination of a contract-manufacturing arrangement. these effects were offset by the positive development of unit sales, especially in europe, china and latin america, and by exchange-rate effects. prior-year ebit included expenses in connection with takata airbags (€83 million) and expenses from a voluntary severance program at the düsseldorf plant (€38 million). daimler buses sold 28,700 buses and bus chassis worldwide in financial year 2017 (2016: 26,200). the significant increase was due especially to the gradual recovery of the economy in brazil. the division thus maintained its clear market leadership in its most important traditional core markets eu30 (european union, switzerland, norway), brazil, argentina and mexico. in another ongoing positive development, sales of complete buses in the eu30 region were at the same high level as in the prior year. revenue grew by 4% to €4.4 billion. the division's ebit of €243 million was at the high prior-year level (2016: €249 million). return on sales decreased slightly to 5.6% (2016: 6.0%). further efficiency enhancements and higher unit sales in latin america almost offset the inflation-related cost increase in latin america and the negative exchange-rate effects. daimler financial services concluded 1.9 million new financing and leasing contracts worth a total of €70.7 billion in 2017. the total value of all new contracts rose by 14% compared to the prior year. about half of all new-vehicle sales by the automotive divisions in 2017 were supported by sales financing from daimler financial services. more than 4.8 million financed or leased vehicles were on the books at the end of 2017, with a total contract volume of €139.9 billion — this represents a 6% increase compared with the end of 2016. adjusted for exchange-rate effects, contract volume increased by 12%. the division posted ebit of €1,970 million in 2017, thus significantly surpassing its prior-year earnings of €1,739 million. the return on equity was 17.6% (2016: 17.4%). this positive development was the result of increased contract volume and a further improvement in the cost-of-risk situation. on the other hand, there were negative effects from a higher interest-rate level, increased expenses for the expansion of mobility services and the digitization of the business system. daimler financial services once again expanded its range of innovative mobility services in 2017. car2go increased the number of customers its car-sharing service to around 3.0 million, thus maintaining its position as the world's leading company for flexible car sharing. the moovel app also underwent further development in 2017. moovel enables customers in germany to compare various mobility and transport-system options and then choose the best way to get from point a to point b. the app can also be used to book and directly pay for services provided by companies such as car2go, mytaxi and deutsche bahn. the number of registered users in germany and the united states had risen to 3.7 million by the end of 2017 (2016: 2.2 million). in 2017, mytaxi further expanded and consolidated its position as europe's biggest taxi app through its successful merger with hailo and its acquisition of taxibeat and clever taxi. the number of registered users increased by 85% to 11.1 million. a total of 17.8 million customers are registered for daimler mobility services, which are offered in more than 100 cities in europe, north america and china. ""with its mobility services, daimler financial services is a pioneer in the future area of shared and services,"" said bodo uebber. ""from a strategic perspective, we want to achieve four goals with our mobility services: first of all, we want to participate in a rapidly growing market that can reach a three-digit billion amount in the coming years. we want to offer our customers a broad ecosystem all around the connected car. in other words, we will make our service portfolio even more attractive and offer additional innovative services. the goal is to develop the required expertise and resources so that we are a leader in the future business with robot taxis."" the reconciliation of the divisions' ebit to group ebit comprises gains and/or losses at the corporate level and the effects on earnings of eliminating intra-group transactions between the divisions. items at the corporate level resulted in expenses of €254 million (2016: €333 million). in 2017, this primarily comprises expenses related to legal proceedings. on the other hand, the reversal of an impairment of €240 million of daimler's at-equity investment in baic motor had a positive effect on earnings. in 2016, there were expenses of €400 million in connection with a legal proceeding, the impairment of €244 million of daimler's at-equity investment in baic motor, and losses of €241 million from currency transactions not allocated to business operations. the gain of €605 million recognized on the contribution of the renault s.a. and nissan motor company ltd. shares into the german pension plan assets did not offset those expenses. the elimination of intra-group transactions resulted in expenses of €45 million in 2017 (2016: income of €17 million). a further increase in investment in the future of the company ""we are making use of our technological expertise and the profitability of the core business to tackle the major issues of our industry's future. we describe them with the acronym case. that stands for the combination of connectivity, autonomous, sharing and electric mobility,"" said zetsche. ""so it's about nothing less than the reinvention of individual mobility."" against this backdrop, research and development expenditure was increased in 2017 from the already very high level by another 15% to €8.7 billion. in order to implement the growth strategy with new products, innovative technologies and modern production facilities, the innovation offensive will be pushed forward in the coming years, with a focus on the future areas of case. investment in property, plant and equipment was also increased in 2017 from the already very high level to €6.7 billion (2016: €5.9 billion). investment in property, plant and equipment primarily flows into production preparations for the new models. other important areas are the realignment of production facilities in germany, local production in the growth markets, and the development of a worldwide production network for electric vehicles and batteries. corporate strategy: core, case, culture, company to keep daimler at the forefront, the company is focusing on four strategic areas for action. daimler intends to strengthen its financial basis through profitable growth in the global core business: core. the group makes use of its profitability to shape the radical transformation of the automotive industry. to those ends, daimler invests in the case areas of the future – connected, autonomous, shared & services and electric – with the goal of strengthening the core business over the long term. in order to effectively support the transformation, daimler is renewing its corporate culture together with the employees: culture. by means of the targeted realignment, the company intends to utilize market opportunities even better: company. in october 2017, daimler announced its intention to further focus and strengthen the group's business structures by creating legally independent entities: the idea is that alongside the existing legally independent division daimler financial services, the divisions mercedes-benz cars & vans and daimler trucks & buses will have more business responsibility as two new legally independent entities. in the coming months, there will be an extensive and thorough due diligence of all economic, tax-related and organizational issues of the projected structure. ""in the case of a positive result of the feasibility study, we would give the go-ahead for the new company structure in the year 2018,"" said uebber. this project is intended to strengthen the future viability of the divisions so that the growth and earnings potential of the respective markets can be utilized even better. securing daimler's future is based on three elements: maintaining and enhancing the group's success, making progress with protecting the employees' future, and ensuring the investors' long-term commitment to daimler. in connection with the balance of interests, daimler transferred €3 billion from its liquid resources into the german pension plan assets of daimler ag in the fourth quarter of 2017, thus ensuring a high level of funding for the pension obligations. at the same time, the company is strongly emphasizing its pension commitments to the employees, and also aims to help consolidate daimler's a-ratings. outlook: world economy should continue its positive development at the beginning of 2018, the world economy continues to develop with solid growth. it is assumed that this dynamism will also continue as the year progresses. growth prospects for both the advanced economies and the emerging markets are similarly positive as they were last year. overall, the world economy should expand in 2018 at a similarly favorable rate as in the previous year, with growth of significantly more than 3% . outlook: further growth of automotive markets in 2018, worldwide demand for cars is likely to increase again from an already high level. according to current forecasts, slight growth of approximately 2% is to be expected. slight market growth is expected once again in europe and china. the us market will be similar to its prior-year volume and the recovery of demand in the emerging markets should continue. in europe, a slight increase in overall car sales is expected. as the market volume in western europe is now above average again, demand is expected to remain fairly stable. in eastern europe, however, a significant increase in sales volumes is anticipated primarily due to the ongoing recovery of the russian market. the us market for cars and light trucks should maintain its high level of approximately 17 million units sold. despite the favorable economic outlook, daimler believes a further increase is unlikely because the market can be regarded as being fairly saturated at this level. the chinese car market continues to be significantly affected by regulatory conditions. at the beginning of this year, the tax rate on purchases of cars with small engines (up to 1.6 liters) was raised back to its normal level of 10%. as this led to purchases being brought forward to late 2017, more moderate demand is to be expected in the first months of this year. in full-year 2018, the chinese market should expand slightly nonetheless. in japan, it is assumed that the car market will undergo a slight downward correction, but demand in india should continue to grow significantly. thanks to the continuation of a positive investment climate worldwide, demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks should increase significantly in most of the relevant regions . in the nafta region, a cyclical recovery of the truck market is to be expected and daimler anticipates a significant increase in overall sales in weight classes 6-8. in an ongoing favorable economic environment, it is assumed that demand in the eu30 region will maintain the robust market volume of the previous year. after the long weakness of demand of recent years in brazil, it is to be expected that a somewhat livelier economic recovery will also bring about significant growth of the truck market, although from a very low level. the turkish market should also grow significantly from its present low level. in russia, further significant growth in demand for trucks is expected. the most important asian markets from daimler's perspective are likely to present a varied picture in 2018. in the japanese market for light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, a slight market correction at an ongoing solid level is anticipated. for the indonesian truck daimler anticipates a positive development. in india, demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks should recover significantly from the market contraction of 2017. in the chinese market, a significant correction is to be expected following the extremely high volume of the previous year. in the eu30 region in 2018, daimler expects slight market growth for small vans , for the combined segment of mid-size and large vans, and for the segment of mid-size pickups. in the united states, demand for large vans should be slightly stronger than in the previous year. the market for large vans in latin america should continue its recovery in 2018. in china, a significant recovery of demand is expected in the relevant market. daimler expects a market volume for buses in the magnitude of the previous year in the eu30 region. the market situation in latin america will be influenced by the economic upturn in argentina and brazil. following the significant decline until 2016 and the turnaround in 2017, it is assumed that the significant market recovery will continue in 2018. outlook: further growth in unit sales mercedes-benz cars will continue along its growth path in 2018. the division intends to slightly increase its total unit sales , thus reaching a new record level. growth is anticipated above all in china. this expectation is based on the attractive and innovative model portfolio, which is more diverse than ever before. mercedes-benz will launch more than a dozen new and upgraded automobiles in 2018. sales should be boosted in particular by the e-class and c-class model families. and the new generation of the compact cars, which will be launched with the a-class this spring, should have a positive impact on unit sales. the product range will become even more attractive as a result of several model upgrades. above all, the new s-class sedan, which has been delivered to customers also as a coupe and convertible since the beginning of 2018, should defend its leading market position in the luxury segment. the division intends to continue this model series' success story with the new cls coupe, which had its premiere at the los angeles auto show in 2017. mercedes-benz cars is well positioned also with its suvs and the upgraded gla, which was launched in 2017. the new g-class will make its mark in this segment as of this spring, and the glc models should continue along their growth path. in addition, the sports-car and high-performance brand mercedes-amg continues to be an important sales driver. more and more customers are fascinated by the broad and appealing range of automobiles offered by mercedes-amg, which is continually expanding. mercedes-benz is systematically expanding its worldwide production network for electric mobility. under the new eq brand , which stands for »electric intelligence«, not only vehicles but also services will be offered in connection with electric mobility. by the year 2022, the car division wants to electrify each segment across the entire model portfolio. the goal is to offer customers at least one electrified alternative in each segment - from the compact car to the large suv. the division plans to have a total of more than 50 electrified models by the year 2022. this will include more than ten fully electric vehicles, the plug-in hybrids and the models with 48-volt technology. as of the year 2020, the smart brand intends to sell solely cars with electric drive in europe and north america, and the other regions will follow in a short-term. the new electric-drive models of the smart fortwo, smart fortwo cabrio and smart forfour (electricity consumption combined: 13.1–12.9 kwh/100 km; co2 emissions combined: 0 g/km) combine the agility of a smart with locally emission-free driving at an affordable price – the ideal combination for urban mobility. daimler trucks assumes that in 2018, its total unit sales will be significantly higher than in the previous year , primarily due to the perceptible recovery of major markets. in the nafta region, the division anticipates unit sales significantly higher than the prior-year level as a result of the ongoing market recovery apparent since the second half-year of 2017. in the eu30 region, unit sales are expected to be in the magnitude of the previous year. in brazil, it is assumed that unit sales in 2018 will significantly surpass the low level of 2017. with the attractive product portfolio in the indian market, daimler trucks expects to significantly increase its unit sales and to further strengthen its market position. furthermore, with the expanded range of fuso vehicles from indian production, there is the opportunity to generate additional sales in asia, africa and latin america. unit sales in indonesia should grow significantly once again, and the truck division expects to sell a similar number of trucks in japan as it did in 2017. mercedes-benz vans plans for a significant increase in unit sales in the year 2018. growth is expected to be particularly strong in china and the united states. significant growth is anticipated also in the eu30 region, due not at least to the new x-class. in the context of the »mercedes-benz vans goes global« strategy, the division has expanded its portfolio with the mercedes-benz x-class, a premium pickup for markets in europe, south africa, australia and new zealand. in latin america, market launch is planned for the year 2019. additional growth is expected in 2018 from the new sprinter, which will be produced also in north america in the future. daimler buses assumes that it will be able to defend its market leadership in its most important traditional core markets for buses above 8 tons with innovative, future-oriented and high-quality products. total unit sales in 2018 are expected to be significantly above the prior-year level. the division assumes that unit sales in the eu30 region will increase perceptibly. after the significant increase in unit sales in latin america last year, a further significant recovery is anticipated in 2018. a positive development of unit sales is expected also in india. daimler financial services aims to achieve ongoing growth in the coming years. in 2018, the division expects further growth in contract volume . this will be primarily driven by the strong development of new business in 2017, which should continue at the same high level this year. daimler financial services is utilizing new market potential above all in china, and by means of new and digital possibilities for customer contacts – in particular through the systematic further development of online sales channels. the division continues to see good growth opportunities in the field of innovative mobility services , where it is active with the brands car2go, moovel and mytaxi, as well as with equity interests in blacklane and flixbus and various startup companies. outlook: slight increase in unit sales and revenue expected, group ebit in the magnitude of the previous year on the basis of the assumptions concerning the development of automotive markets and the divisions' planning, the daimler group expects to slightly increase its total unit sales in 2018. the group also anticipates slight revenue growth in 2018, as a result of the overall positive development of unit sales in the automotive divisions. exchange-rate effects are likely to have a rather negative impact on the development of revenue in the year 2018. this applies above all to the business in the nafta region. the divisions currently have very attractive product ranges, which have been expanded and systematically renewed in recent years. the group therefore assumes that daimler will profit from the slight growth in global demand for motor vehicles that is expected in the year 2018, and that it will be able to strengthen or defend its position in major markets. at mercedes-benz cars, additional growth this year will be primarily driven by the e-class models, the glc suv, the new convertible models and the new a-class. on the other hand, revenue growth will be dampened by the anticipated development of exchange rates and lifecycle effects from some car models, as well as by a changing sales structure. mercedes-benz cars therefore anticipates revenue in 2018 only at the high prior-year level despite a slight increase in unit sales. due to generally positive expectations for markets and unit sales, the daimler trucks division plans for slight revenue growth, while the mercedes-benz vans, daimler buses and daimler financial services divisions anticipate significant increases in revenue. in regional terms, daimler expects further slight growth in revenue in asia and europe. in china, the right conditions have been created for further growth with new sales outlets, additional production capacities and a broad product range. however, growth in unit sales in china will have a disproportionately low impact on revenue growth, as the share of local production will continue to increase. daimler's chinese associated company, beijing benz automotive china (bbac), is included in the consolidated financial statements using the at-equity method of accounting. the anticipated growth in unit sales and revenue will have a generally positive impact on earnings in 2018. the foundations have been laid for a lasting high level of earnings with various programs for improved profitability, which were already implemented in the years 2013 to 2015. since then, daimler has continuously been taking further measures in all divisions for the long-term and structural optimization of its business system. at mercedes-benz cars for example, further efficiency improvements are to be achieved in the context of the f4l (fit for leadership) program. daimler trucks is also working continuously on efficiency improvements with its optimization program. in combination with the cost optimizations so far planned and partially already implemented, daimler trucks aims to achieve profit-effective improvements in an amount of €1.4 billion by the end of 2018. the goal is for these measures to become fully effective in the year 2019. daimler is standardizing and modularizing its production processes throughout the group. in this context, intelligent use is being made of vehicle platforms,

1,"singapore/berlin (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s decision to slap tariffs on solar panel imports is a blow to a booming global industry, and hit stocks in european and asian solar groups on fears their business might suffer. although the move was intended to help american manufacturers, some in the sector said it would slow u.s. investment in solar power and cost thousands of u.s. jobs. trump on monday approved a 30 percent tariff on solar cell and module imports, dropping to 15 percent within four years. up to 2.5 gigawatts (gw) of unassembled solar cells can be imported tariff-free in each year. the news sent sma solar, germany’s largest solar group, which makes 46 percent of its sales in the americas, down 4.6 percent to a four-week low, while norway’s rec silicon shed 1.2 percent. german finance minister peter altmaier said the cost of solar products in the u.s. was likely to increase, and that berlin would discuss the matter with washington. the u.s. has the world’s fourth-largest solar capacity after china, japan and germany. globally, solar capacity soared to almost 400 gw last year from under 10 gw in 2007, according to the international renewable energy administration. the u.s.-based solar energy industries association said the decision could cause the loss of around 23,000 u.s. jobs this year, and result in the delay or cancellation of billions of dollars in solar investments. asia to feel the pain the u.s. government argued that its domestic manufacturers could not compete with what it said were artificially lower-priced asian panels. the chinese firms that are the world’s biggest makers of solar photo-voltaic cells will be hit by the tariffs at their production sites across asia. jack feng, vice president at trina solar, one of china’s top panel makers alongside jinko solar, said his firm would “expand their territory to a broader range in the globe”, including europe, china, indonesia and india. china’s ministry of commerce on tuesday said the decision damaged the global trade environment, and the ministry of industry and information technology said chinese solar companies were likely to curb overseas expansion. “china’s solar industry has been growing at a fast pace in recent years, making itself a target of protectionism in some countries,” it said. south korea said it would “actively respond to u.s. trade protectionism”, including exercising its rights under the world trade organization. morgan stanley warned of wider economic damage as the protectionist stance “could challenge investors’ perception whether the u.s. will adhere to current free trade policies”. potential exemptions there is still uncertainty on when the tariffs will be imposed and how the tariff-free imports will be shared out. sma solar said it could not yet make a full assessment but added: “we do not expect a major collapse of the u.s. market.” shares in u.s. panel maker sunpower climbed 0.8 percent on monday and electric car maker tesla, which also produces solar panels, gained 1.5 percent. yet analysts said the benefits for u.s. firms were not clear-cut. “the overwhelming majority of the 260,000 solar jobs in the u.s. depend on the cheaper imported products,” height securities said. goldman sachs estimated that the tariffs implied “a 3-7 percent cost increase for utility-scale and residential solar costs, respectively”. however, there remains the possibility of some manufacturers winning exclusions. “two key exclusions with respect to technology and certain countries (canada/singapore, among others) were included as part of the (initial) recommendation,” goldman sachs said. canadian solar is one the world’s biggest panel manufacturers. in singapore, unlisted rec operates one of the city-state’s biggest manufacturing sites. doran hole, chief executive officer for north america at u.s.-listed renesola, said there may still be ways to settle the trade dispute. “there is quite a bit of discretion about ... negotiations for a settlement. having a global settlement would certainly be useful to the industry as a whole.” additional reporting by jumin park and jane chung in seoul; muyu xu and josephine mason in beijing; david stanway in shanghai; christoph steitz and vera eckert in berlin; nina chestney in london; peter maushagen and alissa de carbonnel in brussels; editing by kevin liffey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,You're missing the point it Model 3 is the the 4th best selling car in the US last month by the end of the year it should have a month were it becomes the best selling car in the US and it may hold onto that and not let it go. The sales of those cars are all down because of the Model 3 in particular and because of electrics- read the article. That is the thesis. The idea that SUV and trucks amount to something is BS is that was just a auto fossil fuel emissions scam based on the foot print line of lies its not because people like these vehicles more or Americans like them more it was because of fossil fuel collusion that the structurally bankrupt US ICE makers as part of the petrol retail chain cannibalized the value of their other vehicles (traditionally preferred to harder to park friction lined SUV/Trucks) to put more material value into those higher fuel consuming vehicles. But the model 3 is a better value period and that is why its sales are hugely up against ICE cars and ICE cars are down. Its also one idiot Republican prostitute senator has introduced a bill to try to punish people for buying EVs vice ICE cars by actually making them pay a financial penalty- this is called panic on the part of the corrupt group of criminals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"shanghai (reuters) - china’s byd co ltd, backed by warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway inc, warned subsidy cuts for new-energy vehicles could slash its quarterly profit by as much as 90 percent, driving its shares down almost 10 percent. file photo: performers perform next to byd's hybrid electric cars 'yuan' on a stage at byd dreamcast conference in beijing, china, april 11, 2016. reuters/kim kyung-hoon/file photo the squeeze on byd’s profits underscores the challenge carmakers are facing in the world’s largest auto market, which is moving toward pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles with strict quotas set to come into effect next year. byd has invested heavily in battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles amid beijing’s push for greener transport. “(as we are) affected by reduction in new energy vehicles (nevs) subsidies, the profitability of the business, especially for electric buses, has declined substantially so as to bring great pressure to the group’s overall profit,” byd said. the company expects its first-quarter net profit to slump 75.2-91.8 percent from a year ago due to the subsidy cuts. that would put profits for the three months to march between 50 million yuan ($7.96 million) and 150 million yuan, versus 605.8 million yuan a year ago. in february, china’s finance ministry cut subsidies for lower-range nev cars and for some buses, but raised them for vehicles with higher performance. byd’s shares in hong kong and shenzhen both fell as much as 10 percent to multi-month lows in intraday trade on wednesday. “even though people are still buying nevs as subsidies fall, byd’s plight speaks to a tough future for electric cars,” said yale zhang, head of consultancy automotive foresight. byd’s net profit in 2017 fell 19.5 percent to 4.07 billion yuan, roughly in line with preliminary figures release last month. in 2016, the firm’s net profit had jumped almost 80 percent. china’s central government wants the country to be a world leader in nevs and related technologies, but has been looking to phase out financial subsidies that have been behind the rapid growth of the sector. byd said a quota system giving carmakers a “credit score” based on their nev output and performance, set to come into effect next year, would support larger players while “eliminating weaker players in the industry”. domestic and international industry executives have called for continued policy support from beijing to help maintain growth in the world’s largest nev market, where broader auto sales growth is slowing down. byd, which is looking to diversify its businesses into electric batteries and other transport services, should see earnings growth pick up in 2018, with analysts polled by reuters predicting a 50 percent jump in net profit this year.

1,"Martin Williams said: ↑Batch processing is a bit old fashioned these days from what an acquaintance who worked until recently in a car plant told me. In his plant, each car starts as an electronic specification of the finished vehicle. In effect it is a box saying ""I want to be a black car with leather seats, alloy wheels, with the following options..."" As it proceeds through the production process the robots and people interrogate it to see what the chosen option is at that point. Each car can be different in theory anyway, without slowing down production.I admit I don't understand why Tesla doesn't handle things this way, since it's trying to automate everything. It does make sense to do paint spraying on multiple cars of a given color in a row, as there will be some wastage of both time and paint in switching from one color to another. But otherwise, I don't see why doing batch processing would speed up the overall throughput. Certainly they have to use different bins/racks for different parts, but can't all the bins/racks for the various options be put within reach of any given robot arm?Your comment about batch processing being an old-fashioned approach isn't the first comment along those lines, so perhaps there is some truth to it.

1,"hollywood, fla. (reuters) - fmc corp ( fmc.n ) is planning a $500 million initial public offering of a stake in its lithium business on the new york stock exchange this fall, its chief financial officer told reuters on monday, an avenue for investors to gain exposure to the booming electric vehicle market. lithium is a key ingredient in the lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars, a market that is forecast to surge in coming decades on government regulation to cut pollution and customer preferences for “green cars”. u.s.-based fmc, which is primarily a pesticides maker, is planning to sell off around 15 percent of its lithium business in the ipo late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter, cfo paul graves said in an interview. that would give the lithium business a market value of more than $3 billion, below that of lithium giants such as chile’s sqm sqma.sn and u.s.-based albemarle corp ( alb.n ) but ahead of newer australian lithium market entrants. about six months after the ipo, fmc plans to spin out its remaining 85 percent stake in the lithium business to its existing shareholders. they will end up holding shares in the agricultural company and stock in a new, standalone lithium company. fmc will retain no stake in the lithium business, graves said, adding that the unit, which comprises only about 10 percent of fmc’s annual revenue, was taking up more and more management time due to investor interest in the sector. “we think there is a lot of merit in separating it and allowing lithium to have access to its own equity financing, its own balance sheet, to attract, develop and retain its own management team,” he said. asked if anything could prevent an ipo, graves said it could get delayed if market conditions deteriorated. shares in lithium producers plunged on monday after morgan stanley said it expects lithium prices to peak in 2018 and then decline 45 pct by 2021 as demand growth falls far short of what’s needed to absorb sharp supply increases through to 2025. by comparison, fmc expects there to be a lithium deficit in 2025, with expected demand of around 1 million tonnes not being met by supply of around 700,000 tonnes. “this is an industry that has repeatedly failed to bring on its supply in the way it predicted. it is always late and it is always more expensive to operate,” graves said. reporting by nicole mordant in hollywood, florida; editing by lisa shumaker and sandra maler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"january 24, 2018 / 2:20 pm / in a few seconds big oil flush with cash again, but no party yet ron bousso 5 min read  london (reuters) - the world’s top oil companies are expected to generate more cash in 2018 than at any other time this decade after three painful years of cuts, but it isn’t party time yet.  the shift in sentiment has been rapid as crude prices have risen by more than 50 percent over the past six months to reach $70 a barrel, a level not seen since the crash year of 2014, thanks to global supply cuts led by opec.  only a year ago, many investors still fretted over the sustainability of the sector’s lavish dividend payouts in a weak energy market. now the focus on company boards is gradually switching from slashing jobs and investment to boosting shareholders’ returns and growth.  with memories of the 2014 price collapse still fresh and oil forecast to recover only slowly, frugality remains high on the agenda of boards and investors to ensure that the energy majors produce enough cash to pay dividends while reducing debt that ballooned during the downturn.  “the companies will need to demonstrate over time that lower capital spending can be sustained and that their dividends will remain fully covered,” said jonathan waghorn, energy fund manager at guinness asset management, which holds shares of chevron, total and bp.  “we are cautiously optimistic on their ability to do this, given the dramatic cost reductions in the industry.”  oil majors responded to the crisis by transforming their businesses, nearly halving spending, culling tens of thousands of jobs and diluting share value.  in 2017, most companies showed they can adapt to a world of lower prices and even generate thin profits with oil at $50-$55 a barrel, without borrowing.  this year, when prices are expected to hold around $60 a barrel, the majors will generate more cash than they did in 2011 when a barrel of crude traded at an average of $112, according to bmo capital markets analyst brendan warn.  dutch shell appears the strongest performer among the group in terms of organic free cash flow - money available to return to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks after deducting capital spending, excluding revenue from disposals.  shell alone will account for a quarter of the roughly $80 billion of organic free cash flow that the top seven oil majors are expected to generate in 2018, warn said.  this follows the anglo-dutch company’s scrapping at the end of last year of its scrip program. these allow investors to opt to receive dividends in shares, saving the companies cash upfront but diluting their earnings per share.  shell’s organic free cash flow yield, the ratio between cash flow and market capitalization, is set to double in 2019 from 2011-2014 to 8.84 percent, according to bmo.  the comparative yield for exxon, though a larger company than shell, will be only 5.39 percent, bmo forecast. bp’s yield will rise in 2019 to 6.55 percent while that of chevron will reach 7.16 percent. growth  the priority for boards and many investors is boosting share value through buying back stock, reversing the years of dilution caused by the scrip programs. for exxon and chevron the focus will be more on boosting dividends.  “with the scrips coming off and share buybacks to commence, we expect an uplift in shareholder distributions by around $24 billion, led by shell,” warn said  executives will also try to reduce debt levels that soared in recent years as companies borrowed to maintain dividends.  “the best use of excess fund flow now would be a little further debt reduction for those companies that need it, and then an end to the scrip dividend,” said darren sissons, partner and portfolio manager at toronto-based campbell, lee & ross investment management.  with whatever is left, sissons expects boards to invest a “small but increasing allocation to growth initiatives” such as exploration for new oil and gas resources, renewables and chemicals.  despite the past cuts in exploration budgets, the majors’ output will increase until 2020 as projects approved during the boom years earlier in the decade come on stream. thereafter, the outlook is less certain but chief executives have made clear their current focus is on raising returns, not volume.  forecasts of a sharp rise in electric vehicle purchases have weighed on the long-term outlook for the oil companies, many of which are increasingly focusing on supplying gas to the power sector as well as making small investments in renewables. reporting by ron bousso; editing by david stamp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"detroit (reuters) - ford motor co ( f.n ) on wednesday outlined a plan to cut costs and boost profit margins at a faster pace than previously announced, which includes dropping traditional sedan models in north america that have become increasingly unpopular with consumers. the ford logo is seen at the new york auto show in the manhattan borough of new york city, new york, u.s., march 29, 2018. reuters/shannon stapleton the no. 2 u.s. automaker said it now plans to cut $25.5 billion in costs by 2022, up from $14 billion in cuts it announced last fall. ford chief executive jim hackett told investors the company is undergoing “a profound refocus” of its operations and may exit unprofitable businesses. “we’ll restructure as necessary, and we’ll be decisive,” he said. “we’re going to feed the healthy part of our business,” and dispose of marginal operations, hackett added. ford said it expects pretax profit margins of 8 percent globally and 10 percent in north america by 2020, ahead of a previous target of 2022. the company’s stock was up 2.6 percent at $11.40 in after-hours trading. responding to a shift in consumer demand to suvs and pickup trucks, ford said it planned to trim its north american car portfolio to just two models: the sporty mustang, which debuted 50 years ago this month, and a new compact crossover called focus active starting in 2019. ford “will not invest in next generations of traditional ford sedans for north america,” including the midsize fusion and full-size taurus, the company said. the automaker has been under pressure from wall street investors to improve its product lineup and lift flagging profit margins. in 2017, the company’s pretax profit fell to $8.4 billion from $10.3 billion. in march, ford executives unveiled ambitious plans to shift the struggling automaker’s product portfolio from passenger cars to suvs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and reduce development and manufacturing costs - aimed at boosting profits and the automaker’s share price. speaking to reporters on wednesday as the company reported first-quarter results, chief financial officer bob shanks said “we have looked at every single part of the business . . . we are driven to turn this business around.” ford reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, with a 7 percent increase in revenue and a lower effective tax rate offsetting a jump in costs, especially higher commodity prices. the company reported a first-quarter net profit of $1.74 billion, or 43 cents per share, up from $1.6 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. analysts had on average expected earnings per share of 41 cents. despite the higher profit, ford’s adjusted pretax profit margin fell to 5.2 percent from 6.4 percent in the same quarter in 2017. cfo shanks said the company expected that commodity costs would represent a $1.5 billion “headwind” in 2018, $500 million of which came in the first quarter. the lion’s share of the automaker’s quarterly profit was driven by high-margin pickup trucks and suvs in north america. europe was the only other region to turn a profit for ford. the company’s loss in its asia pacific region was driven by slumping sales in china, where ford has just begun to introduce new models. shanks said the lincoln brand still is losing money in china, where it launched in 2015, but now plans to begin local production there in 2020. joe hinrichs, president of global operations, said ford plans to build a new product its hermosillo plant in mexico when it quits production of the fusion sedan, and will also build a new battery electric vehicle in mexico. reporting by nick carey and paul lienert; editing by jonathan oatis and lisa shumaker",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"beijing, april 20 (reuters) - china’s state-owned automaker faw group agreed to invest a “significant amount of money” in chinese-funded electric vehicle startup byton, the startup’s co-founder and chief executive, carsten breitfeld, said on friday. byton would not disclose the scale of faw’s investment, but breitfeld, a former bmw executive, said faw’s stake in byton “will be so small that they don’t have any kind of control of us.” he spoke with reuters ahead of the announcement. breitfeld said faw will likely make use of byton’s technology to develop its own brand called hongqi or red flag more into a new-energy car brand. the agreement for cooperation, signed in beijing, had been negotiated for some time. but the announcement of it came in the wake of china’s decision earlier this week to scrap as early as this year foreign ownership restrictions on new-energy vehicle or electric vehicle companies in the country. some industry experts speculated the scrapping of those restrictions, which opens the door for companies such as tesla inc to produce cars on its own in china and sell them at more affordable price points, might weaken the business case for new electric-car startups such as byton. breitfeld said byton was not seeking for help from faw. in fact, he said state-owned faw is the one who sought out byton. “they’re not buying our company, and we definitely will stay independent,” breitfeld said. byton is interested in gaining access to faw’s supply chains for automotive components such as ev batteries, breitfeld said. faw was not immediately available to respond to reuters’ call for comment. in february, u.s. autonomous driving startup aurora added byton to its growing list of clients for self-driving systems.

0,"february 22, 2018 / 4:28 pm / updated 35 minutes ago commentary: for cobalt buyers, is artisanal mining the problem or the solution? andy home 7 min read london (reuters) - one reason the cobalt price has gone supernova over the last year is the realisation that not only does most of the available supply come from just one country, the democratic republic of congo (drc), but a good part of it comes from artisanal mines. in the case of cobalt, however, artisanal mining may in fact be part of the solution to securing long-term supplies of the “hot” metal used for lithium-ion batteries key to the electric vehicle revolution. the real problem in the drc is less this mining itself, but more the lawlessness that surrounds it and makes much of the cobalt from the region effectively a “conflict mineral”. for as apple has already found out and automotive companies are learning, it’s tricky enough selling yourself as a pioneer of 21st century technology if one of your key raw materials conjures up images of impoverished children wheeling barrows laden with ore or being lowered into rickety tunnels. such stark representations of small-scale mining, however, risk over-simplifying the “informal” sector, which is a major employer and plays a crucial economic and development role for millions of people around the world. a global informal economy the world bank estimates that artisanal mining, by small cooperative or family groups, employs some 40 million people globally. (“artisanal and small-scale mining”, nov. 21, 2013). it’s inevitably a rough guess, but the world bank’s assessment implies that some 100 million people, workers and their families depend on the sector for their livelihood. the comparable world figure for the official industrial mining sector is seven million people. and artisanal mining probably represents around 15-20 percent of all global minerals and metals production, first and foremost gold, diamonds and other precious stones, according to the international institute for environment and development. it thrives on a combination of resource wealth and income poverty, a toxic brew found in many developing countries, particularly countries like the drc, which has one of the starkest divides between mineral riches and local poverty. mining violence there may be around two million artisanal workers operating in the drc, the country’s chamber of mines estimates. (“2015 annual report”). as in the rest of the world, most of them are digging for gold, diamonds and semi-precious stones such as tourmaline. however, around 200,000 are working copper-cobalt mines and a similar number “3t” (tin, tungsten and tantalum) deposits. belgian research group ipis, with backing from the drc’s ministry of mines, has conducted invaluable research into the artisanal mining camps in the east of the country. its researchers visited 1,615 sites between 2013 and 2015, calculating that 240,000 artisanal workers were employed on them, around 80 percent of them searching for gold. the alarming statistic from ipis is that “at least one armed actor was present” at 56 percent of all visited sites. the congolese army was found to be running mines accounting for 26 percent of the artisanal workforce with “at least one non-state armed group” present at 25 percent of mine sites. the congolese wars at the turn of the century never really ended and factions are still clashing in the eastern part of the country, with millions of people fleeing a new flare-up described by secretary general of the norwegian refugee council, jan egeland, as “violence by hundreds of armed groups”. these factions are drawn to the artisanal mining sector for money, whether in the form of “taxation” on miners, forced labour or just plain pillaging. and the resulting output is correctly called “conflict minerals”. problem or solution? much of the drc’s artisanal production is smuggled out of the country, depriving the government of much-needed revenue. but a lot of it has also been seeping into domestic mineral supply chains and amnesty international has warned of “significant risk of cobalt mined by children in the drc ending up in the batteries of electric cars”. (“industry giants fail to tackle child labour allegations in cobalt battery supply chains,” nov. 15, 2017). while this is the stuff of pr nightmares for automotive companies, so too is an inability to lock in future supply. but could the “problem” of artisanal mining also be the solution? a template already exists in the itri tin supply chain initiative (itsci), which was born out of the concerns of companies such as apple about whether “3t” minerals from conflict parts of the drc were entering their supply chains. it has been running for several years in the tin-rich south kivu province and now encompasses more than 50,000 miners. not only does it promote better health and safety, it also facilitates audited mine-to-smelter “clean” supply chains. apple has spent the last two years devising a similar mechanism for its cobalt purchases, tracing its sourcing all the way back to the drc mine site. its most recent annual “supplier responsibility progress report” includes for the first time a list of cobalt suppliers. three out of the six refiners, all chinese players, are still working on their audit trails, but apple explains that “we’ve consciously chosen to stay engaged with mines and smelters that are not yet meeting our high standards and will work with them to develop responsible practices.” “we know there are real challenges with artisanal mining of cobalt, but walking away from it indefinitely would be harmful to communities who rely on this mining for their income.” the world bank agrees, arguing that artisanal mining supports millions of families in an estimated 80 countries, diversifies rural economies away from subsistence farming and can have a significant wealth distribution impact. the bank has programmes in various countries aimed both at bringing artisanal mining into the official economy and educating miners as to why, for example, they really don’t need to use polluting mercury to produce gold. integrating the artisanal cobalt miners of the drc into the formal supply chain would make both economic and moral sense, but first requires an end to the lawlessness whose main victims include the miners themselves.

0,"april 27, 2018 / 2:56 am / updated 16 hours ago the auto plants of the future may have a surprisingly human touch norihiko shirouzu , edward taylor , nick carey 7 min read (reuters) - carmakers have big plans for their next generation of factories: smarter designs, artificial intelligence and collaborative robots building a wide range of vehicles on the same line. general motors assembly workers connect a battery pack underneath a partially assembled 2018 chevrolet bolt ev vehicle on the assembly line at orion assembly in lake orion, michigan, u.s., march 19, 2018. photo taken march 19, 2018. reuters/rebecca cook the plants will also feature a component they say is the secret ingredient to flexible manufacturing: humans. saic-gm’s factory in shanghai, which opened in 2016, is one of the world’s most advanced auto plants, assembling buick minivans and cadillac sedans and suvs, including the ct-6 plug-in hybrid for u.s. consumers. gm’s shanghai plant is expected to eventually produce new electric vehicles, primarily for the chinese market, executives have said. the plant, which gm operates with chinese partner saic motor corp ltd, feels almost like a scene from a star wars film, with battalions of machines quietly working in self-directed harmony. collaborative robots, or “cobots,” painted matte green and unrestrained by the steel cages that surround their larger industrial cousins, are being programmed to work alongside humans on the line. one unusual operation advanced models now handle is installing gears in transmissions. “they can actually feel; they can pick up a gear set (and) mesh the gear into a transmission,” paul buetow, gm’s china manufacturing chief, said on a recent tour of the plant. the robots reduce strain on humans and improve quality and consistency. globally, automakers are embracing industry 4.0 — a term coined by german manufacturers for the digitalization and automation of assembly processes — and the consensus is that fewer people will be required in future factories. but humans will still be needed. “this is not about cutting head count,” said an insider familiar with industry efforts to upgrade and streamline auto plants in the united states, china and europe. the focus instead is on improving flexibility and efficiency between machines and humans as automakers figure out how to build multiple models — powered by gas engines, electric motors, or both — in the same factory. “it’s not just blood and sweat that goes into manufacturing on an assembly line,” said united auto workers president dennis williams. “it’s critical thinking that automation can’t replicate.” a general motors assembly worker loads the hic plastic caps at a collaborative robot adhesive station at orion assembly in lake orion, michigan, u.s., march 19, 2018. photo taken march 19, 2018. reuters/rebecca cook doing the dirty work a new generation of cobots is working alongside humans at general motors co plants from shanghai to orion township, michigan. the orion plant, north of detroit, is one of the industry’s most flexible. it builds three models on one line: the gas-engine chevrolet sonic, the battery-powered chevrolet bolt ev and the self-driving cruise av. more than 800 robots work there, including a half-dozen cobots painted green to denote they can safely operate around humans. the machines handle the “dirty, dull, difficult and dangerous” tasks while people do the work requiring dexterity and intelligence, says marty linn, gm’s principal engineer for robotics. in one section of the plant, cobots glue protective pads onto headliners, a tough job for humans because the glue is heated to scalding temperatures before it is applied. at another station, a cobot takes new spare tires off a conveyor belt and stacks them on a cart. this, gm’s linn said, was a job workers universally hated because it was repetitive and back-breaking. at the end of the line, cobots ensure headlamps are properly aligned. they will also be used to test sensors on automated vehicles, linn said. markus schaefer, head of production and supply chain at daimler ag’s mercedes-benz cars, said the german automaker is “paring back automation” in final assembly to boost flexibility. slideshow (12 images) “we need this because we are making a greater variety of derivatives and, as a premium automaker, we make highly individualized vehicles,” he said. schaefer said mercedes will eventually have plants that can build vehicles with different powertrains and with both front- and rear-wheel drive. the automaker is converting its showcase sindelfingen plant to build the gla, a compact front-wheel-drive utility vehicle, as well as its rear-wheel-drive s-class luxury sedan. shaping the future how collaborative robots and other digital tools are used will determine the size and layout of future factories - and how many humans work there. ford motor co executive joe hinrichs created a stir last october when detailing the automaker’s vision of a future factory for electric vehicles, which have fewer parts than those with combustion engines and thus would require far less floor space, fewer workers and lower investment. but like other major global carmakers, ford appears reluctant to invest in dedicated electric-vehicle plants until there is sufficient - and consistent - demand to justify the expense. ford has years of experience building different types of vehicles on one line, including versions of the focus compact with gasoline engines and electric motors. ford has installed a few collaborative robots at its recently renovated louisville, kentucky, truck plant. the company is also using digital tools such as including augmented reality to map new assembly lines, and predictive analytics to schedule repairs and maintenance before machines break down. the company has no immediate plans for a separate, highly automated plant for its next-generation electric vehicles, some of which are expected to share factory space with traditional combustion-engine models, according to sources familiar with ford’s strategy. an april report by barclays’ global auto investment team predicted “robots won’t kill all automotive jobs,” at least not in the near term. auto companies are working on “perfecting the combination of human and robot,” according to the report, because “the human touch is still necessary.” even tesla chief executive elon musk, who long praised robots’ virtues and promised to turn his california electric car factory into a highly automated “alien dreadnought,” has had something of an epiphany. bedeviled by technical glitches, musk recently tweeted: “excessive automation at tesla was a mistake ... humans are underrated.” edward taylor reported from frankfurt, germany, norihiko shirouzu reported from shanghai and nick carey reported from detroit; written by paul lienert; edited by gerry doyle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"(reuters) - tesla inc ( tsla.o ) chief executive officer elon musk acknowledged on friday that it was “foolish” of him to snub analysts on a conference call earlier in the week, but further needled wall street with a series of accusatory tweets. in a post-earnings call on wednesday, musk refused to answer questions from analysts on the electric vehicle maker’s capital requirements, saying “boring, bonehead questions are not cool,” before turning questions over to a little known investor who runs hyperchange, a youtube investment channel. the outspoken performance shocked many analysts, sparked a fall in tesla’s share price and led some to question whether musk’s behavior could risk the company’s ability to raise capital. in early-morning tweets on friday, musk said the two analysts he cut off - rbc capital markets’ joseph spak and bernstein’s toni sacconaghi - “were trying to justify their tesla short thesis.” ‘shorting’ means they were betting the stock would fall, but the two have ‘hold’ or ‘neutral’ ratings on the stock, according to thomson reuters data. “i should have answered their questions live. it was foolish of me to ignore them,” musk tweeted. the two analysts were not immediately available for a comment. the spat comes at a crunch time for tesla, when it is struggling to ramp up production of its model 3 sedan, on which its profitability depends. it is trying to build 5,000 of the vehicles per week by the end of june and overcome manufacturing hurdles that have delayed its rollout. related coverage factbox: musk seeks to soothe wall street nerves after snub although musk has insisted the company neither needs nor wants new funding, many believe the company will seek to raise more capital by the end of 2018. tesla’s stock recovered a little on friday, up 2.4 percent at $291 in early afternoon trade. but short sellers, who shorted nearly 400,000 shares on thursday, doubled that amount on friday, according to financial analytics firm s3 partners. “musk’s meltdown will change tesla’s ability to raise capital when he needs it with a sector of investors,” said eric schiffer, chief executive of the patriarch organization, a los angeles-based private-equity firm. “at this critical point, he needs to reinforce confidence, not raise a narrative of him as unstable and whose rational side is lost in space,” said schiffer, who does not hold tesla shares. jefferies analyst philippe houchois said the underlying business fundamentals were more important in any capital raise, although “management credibility” was also a factor. spacex founder elon musk pauses at a press conference following the first launch of a spacex falcon heavy rocket at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida, u.s., february 6, 2018. reuters/joe skipper “that has an impact but it’s not something that will prevent them from raising capital,” houchois said. nord lb analyst frank schwope said that musk’s refusal to answer questions or receive criticism was “not very clever” but added that his ability to find new money was still intact. ‘dry’ questions the questions musk cut short on wednesday related to model 3 reservations and capital requirements. ""the 'dry' questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their tesla short thesis. they are actually on the *opposite* side of investors,"" musk tweeted on friday. twitter.com/elonmusk “hyperchange represented actual investors, so i switched to them,” he wrote. on the call, he devoted 23 minutes to 25-year-old tesla investor, galileo russell, who runs hyperchange tv. at least three brokerages cut price targets on the stock following the call. sacconaghi, one of the rebuffed quote: : “we do worry that such theatrics will unnecessarily undermine investor confidence in tesla’s outlook.” sacconaghi has a price target of $265 on tesla’s stock and spak lowered his target to $280 from $305 on thursday. tesla’s median wall street price target is $317. reporting by supantha mukherjee and arjun panchadar in bengaluru, additional reporting by munsif vengattil; writing by alexandria sage; editing by bernard orr and rosalba o'brien",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

curtailing or deferring high spending that added up to $3.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2017; and improving gross margins. the dearth of information about tesla’s multiple capital-intensive projects - from the model y crossover this year, the partially built battery gigafactory in nevada, and the semi truck and roadster, forecast to begin production in 2019 and 2020 - complicates the task. “there are a lot of moving parts there,” andrew walker of rangeley capital, which holds a small short position in tesla, said on wednesday. “it’s just so many questions and such a black box, it’s very difficult to determine going forward.” shorts bet that a share price will fall. tesla shares were up 1 percent at $283.67 on thursday afternoon. its shares have fallen over 9 percent so far this year. ubs analyst colin langan has estimated that tesla - which ended 2017 with $3.37 billion in cash - could fall below a cushion of $1 billion at the end of june due to estimated negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. some, like bernstein, put that estimate higher, at negative $1.8 billion. file photo: spacex founder elon musk speaks at a press conference following the first launch of a spacex falcon heavy rocket at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida, u.s., february 6, 2018. reuters/joe skipper/file photo subtracting another $1.2 billion for 2018 debt refinancing and accrued liabilities reduces tesla’s cash level to $600 million, ubs calculates. using a more bullish free cash flow model, such as morgan stanley’s first-half estimate of negative $880 million, tesla would still hover just above the cushion, at $1.3 billion. “tesla may not ‘need’ to raise funds, but many investors expect that the company will very much ‘want’ to,” wrote morgan stanley’s adam jonas in a note published last week. much hinges on efficient, volume production of the model 3 along with tight spending control. tesla aims to build 3,000-4,000 model 3s per week next month, up from more than 2,000 model 3s today, and to increase production to 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. building 5,000 model 3s per week priced at $44,000 would yield revenue of $2.64 billion per quarter, although efficiency determines how much of that trickles down to the bottom line. but those calculations may be moot. morgan stanley’s jonas noted that “no investor that we have spoken to expects model 3 production of 5k/week by the end of 2q’18.” ‘losing credibility’ tesla has repeatedly underestimated its capital requirements and has raised money, whether through equity or debt, even after claiming it had no need to do so. “the company’s financial predictions may be losing credibility within the financial community,” wrote cowen & co analyst jeffrey osborne in a note to clients earlier this month. since march, short interest in the stock has risen sharply to 30 percent of float, or shares available for trading. currently, analysts, on average, predict tesla will not reach profitability on a non-gaap basis until the first quarter of 2019. according to thomson reuters data, analysts see adjusted losses of $217.6 million and $40.1 million in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, after revising estimates downward to twice the losses they expected at the end of 2017. they expect, on average, negative cash flow of $125 million and $67 million in the third and fourth quarters. other one-off factors influencing profit include the sale of zero emission vehicle (zev) credits or deposits from model y customers. musk’s recent admission that he erred in adding too much automation into the model 3 assembly line could also prove an expensive mistake to unwind. the model 3 targets a 25 percent gross margin when fully ramped, but with production line stoppages and the need to hire 400 more hourly workers, the vehicle’s negative margins today could be further pressured in the short-term. with all that in mind, a 2018 capital raise, according to ubs’s langan, is “a question of when, not if.” reporting by alexandria sage;

I pulled up March figures this morning, the first link I saw, and Camry was at 24,xxx, while its competitors were lower. Just now I've checked May's numbers and they are higher (Camry did 29,848 in May).So, I don't see Model 3 hitting 35k a month for a while -- probably not this year. If it can get up to 21.4K, that's certainly approaching the neighbourhood of the top selling sedans.They'll get production there eventually. I think the bigger challenge may be sustaining that sort of demand once it does. It's a declining segment overall, and I think the Kona, and any number of other electric crossovers are going to eat into its market share. Though, then again, it remains to be seen what kind of numbers the competition is capable of producing as well. They seem to be having a hard time keeping up with demand at this point. Them it becomes a tale of supply chain.Click to expand...Totally agree with you, the sedan market is dying... People who want EV's line up for Tesla because there are no other compelling options (GM blew it on the Bolt styling and interior), but when Kona and others get out, I feel there will hit Tesla's model 3 backlog hard. Kona is just a more useful vehicle.

0,"china has conceded to a key demand from american carmakers while increasing tariffs on imports of sorghum from the us, as beijing adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to its deepening trade dispute with washington. with the threat of a full-blown trade war hanging over us-china relations, beijing is seeking to show an uncompromising attitude in the face of tariff threats from washington while also yielding to pressure to bring trade policy in sectors such as automobiles in line with global norms. a 178 per cent import duty on imports of us sorghum announced on tuesday came in tandem with plans to continue liberalising its automotive sector. receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the financial times for just $1 . china's state planning agency outlined a five-year timetable to ease restrictions on foreign investment in the car industry and some other manufacturing sectors, in line with a promise made by president xi jinping last week. the moves by beijing came after us president donald trump threatened to impose tariffs on a range of imports from china worth about $150bn a year. after releasing a detailed list of products covering the first $50bn in trade in retaliation for alleged chinese technology theft, us trade officials are working on a similar list for the remaining $100bn that could be released as soon as this week. meanwhile, the debate in washington is intensifying over mr trump's tariff threat, with much of the us business community and republicans in congress opposed because of fears it could spark a trade war between the world's two largest economies. there are also signs that the trump administration is engaged in its own debate between those who favour a quick deal with beijing and those who want to wage a longer conflict aimed at reining in china's economic ambitions. the announcement on tuesday from china's state planning agency will abolish foreign ownership caps on electric vehicles, shipping and aircraft manufacturing by the end of the year, while restrictions on commercial vehicles would be removed by 2020. at present foreign companies wishing to produce cars domestically are required to have a 50-50 joint venture with a local chinese partner. foreign car groups have long complained that beijing's use of ownership caps and joint venture requirements has protected domestic manufacturers at their expense. tu le, head of sino auto insights, a market research company, said the new rules could be meaningful for electric vehicle makers such as tesla that do not already have operations in china. but the changes were unlikely to lead to massive shifts in the way foreign vehicle manufacturers conducted business in china, as most had learnt how to make handsome profits in the country despite the restrictions. ""most of them already have established fully functioning operations in china so this might after all might not be that helpful to them,"" mr le said. by targeting agricultural commodities, beijing can affect the ""red states"" that voted for mr trump in the 2016 presidential election. china imported about 4.8m tonnes of us sorghum last year, worth about $957m, according to customs data. the sorghum levy was in response to a chinese anti-dumping investigation that began in february. ma wenfeng, an analyst at beijing orient agribusiness consultant, said hitting sorghum was a relatively painless move for china because the main reason for large imports was inflated grain prices set by the chinese government that had made us sorghum relatively cheaper. china began importing large amounts of sorghum from the us in 2014. ""it doesn't make a big difference to china if we don't import from the us,"" he said.

0,"by kirsten korosec february 7, 2018  tesla reported wednesday a $675.4 million net loss, or $4.01 per share, in the fourth quarter ending dec. 31 as the automaker continued to invest in ramping up production of its model 3 electric car and its other energy products.  the net loss, which widened from $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, in the previous quarter and from $121.3 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier, was still smaller-than analysts had expected.  tesla took a positive outlook for 2018, saying that “the planned ramp of both model 3 and our energy storage products, our rate of revenue growth this year is poised to significantly exceed last year’s growth rate.”  tesla reported higher than expected revenues of $3.29 billion, a nearly 10% increase from the previous quarter of $2.98 billion. tesla said it had $3.37 billion in cash and cash-equivalents as of dec. 31, compared with $3.53 billion at the end of the third quarter.  here are some initial takeaways from the earnings report: model 3 production forecast  tesla says it expects to produce 2,500 model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 a week by the end of the second quarter.  but but but ….  it is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time. what we can say with confidence is that we are taking many actions to systematically address bottlenecks and add capacity in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our production rate significantly increasing during the rest of q1 and through q2.  tesla’s production problems were revealed in early october when the automaker reported it had produced just 260 of its new model 3 electric cars in the third quarter, of which it delivered 220. things improved in the fourth quarter, but were still below estimates. tesla produced 2,425 of its new model 3 electric cars in the fourth quarter and delivered 1,542.  tesla delivered 28,425 model s and model x vehicles—a 10% increase from the third quarter. capital expenditures  tesla reported that its capital expenditures reached $787 million in the fourth quarter, most of which was spent on model 3 production and its massive battery factory outside of reno, nevada.  the fine print: the company actually spent more than that, but says some capital expenditure payments for the model 3 have been deferred to the first quarter of this year. gross margins  the company beat analysts estimates on revenue. however, its automotive gross margin, which doesn’t include the sale of zero-emission vehicle credits, dropped to 13.8% from 22.2% in the same period last year.  analysts on average had expected margins of 15.7 percent, according to factset, reuters reported . customer deposits  the company also has another unusual source for its reserves: customer deposits. it brings in money through customer deposits on future products, a tactic that many say is unsustainable.  tesla took in $686 million in customer deposits in the third quarter. that figure grew to $853 million, likely thanks to the debut in november of the tesla semi and next-gen roadster both of which have a reservations page . roadster customers must drop $50,000 to make a deposit or if $250,000 if they want to reserve a founder’s series version. an autopilot overhaul  tesla reported it made an “extensive overhaul of the underlying architecture” of its autopilot software. autopilot, which was introduced in 2015, is a semi-autonomous driving software—and the accompanying hardware suite of sensors, cameras, and radar—that company the continues to improve via over-the-air software updates. autopilot  the company says this will enable an improvement in the “collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities.”  the upshot: tesla says it will allow it to rollout out a series of new autopilot features in 2018 and beyond.  tesla also plans to complete its coast-to-coast autonomous drive, a goal that was supposed to be met by the end of 2017. sponsored financial content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"detroit, feb 22 (reuters) - a deal thursday between ups and u.s. electric van maker workhorse group inc shows how the delivery industry is making progress to resolve a major obstacle to deployment of battery-powered commercial vehicles: charging costs. ups, like its rivals in the package delivery business, faces pressure from regulators in major cities around the world to clean up its fleet of petroleum-burning vehicles. ups is partnering with workhorse to build an all-new electric delivery van. the first 50 vehicles with a driving range of 100 miles (160 km) will be delivered in 2018. that range is enough to allow ups to replace around 35,000 diesel or gasoline delivery trucks, company officials said. until recently, however, ups would have faced substantial costs for the charging stations and related infrastructure to top up the batteries at the end of the day. “with the large-scale deployments of vehicles, if you can’t put them somewhere to take advantage of them then it’s irrelevant,” scott phillippi, ups senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told reuters. “we have to have solutions in place to make that happen.” solutions for the charging problem are now in sight, ups and other industry officials say. ups recently rolled out “smart charging” software at a central london facility that allowed the company to nearly triple its local electric fleet to 170 delivery vans. the smart charging technology determines when and how fast to charge vehicles. if vehicles are not scheduled for a full route the next day, the system can opt not to fully charge them and charge other vehicles more. without the software, ups would have had to install enough infrastructure to charge all the vehicles at the same time - the equivalent of powering an office building or hospital - at a cost of millions of dollars for electric grid hardware. the project at ups’s london facility was partly funded by innovate uk, the british government innovation agency. if successful, ups will use its london experience as a blueprint around the world as it expands its electric delivery vehicle fleet. ups’ approach could also serve as a model for smaller companies that cannot afford major infrastructure investments. “if this solution didn’t exist, it would cost too much money for small companies to upgrade their connection capacity,” said christos keramisanos, a consultant at uk power networks services (ukpns) in charge of the ups project in london. electric delivery charging costs are critical as delivery fleet operators calculate the costs of switching to electric vehicles. hermes, a european delivery service, plans to deploy 1,500 electric mercedes vans, and is working with daimler ag’s commercial van unit to design recharging systems that do not require new transformers or large numbers of individual charging stations, said benjamin kaehler, head of mercedes’ electric van business. mercedes’ goal is to structure charging costs so an electric van has the same total cost of ownership as a petroleum-fueled van over three years, kaehler told reuters. cheaper charging is key to that goal. “that’s the breakthrough,” he said. u.s. truck leasing and rental company ryder system inc , which has bought electric vans from chanje, a unit of china’s fdg electric vehicles ltd, is already training its technical and sales staff on smart charging technology. “ryder is aware the world is going electric and we are preparing for that future,” said chris nordh, ryder’s director of advanced vehicle technology. “smart charging is key to creating scale.” regulations lagging developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments - $1.7 trillion in battery plants, manufacturing and chargers, and $1 trillion on distribution and generation capacity, said balu balagopal, a partner in a.t. kearney’s energy practice. his estimate is based on an assumption that 64 percent of the global vehicle fleet is electrified by 2040. utility regulations are an obstacle. the united states lacks national standards for recovering the costs of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure. for tesla’s “semi” big rig - far larger than a delivery van - customers such as pepsico inc, anheuser-busch inbev and ups plan to build their own charging stations. california has moved to allow utilities to recoup investments and is reviewing proposals from utilities to spend more than $1 billion over five years on electrification infrastructure for cars, buses and trucks. other states do not allow utilities to spread electric vehicle infrastructure costs across their broad base of ratepayers. “the right structures haven’t been put in place to allow us to operate and participate in this market,” said lang reynolds, electric transportation manager at duke energy corp of charlotte, north carolina, which serves several southeastern u.s. states. reporting by nick carey; editing by lisa shumaker",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know about the cost to charge as apparently each network has their own price structure.Have you done any long trips that required remote charging?Bob WilsonClick to expand...We've had our Kona about 9 months now and driven around 8700km. We normally don't go on long trips, especially in winter time, but we did drive to Sweden last autumn which is around 2 hours from us. The good thing about our Kona is the range, and managed 515km on a fully charged battery. Obviously the range is reduced in winter because of climate control use and cold battery. We normally set our charge limit to 80% which is adequate for our daily use, and because of it's great range we haven't needed a CCS charger yet. The supercharger network in Europe is expanding rapidly, but still not as widespread as the Tesla network. One really disappointing feature compared to our previous Kia Soul EV and diesel Nissan Qashqai is that the ESC on our Kona EV (Electronic Stability Control) is useless compared to the others.

We track Tesla sales, not Vanja, and we place no importance on Bloomberg as far as IEV estimates are concerned.As I explained months ago in this very thread:Bloomberg Model 3 tracker shows production crashing below 1000/week""The Bloomberg production tracker is often incorrect because it is not adjusted on the fly or corrected when it is wrong. And it is never outright stopped.Bloomberg over-estimated April production by at about 3,000 units. Primarily this is because they did not account for the 5 days when production was down. Or the 3-5 days immediately following when production ramped back up to previous levels.The current production is not 1,000 units / week. Far more than that. Rather than simply correct their number, they are adjusting it below actual production for a few weeks to offset the inflated numbers. Within 2-3 weeks it should be back on track.The bloomberg tracker is useful and interesting to look back on over time. But it isn't particularly useful as a real time estimator. ""I'm not interested in anything other than the most accurate numbers available. As a result we were less than 500 units off of U.S. delivery estimates in Q2 and about a dozen off for combined U.S. + Canadian deliveries in Q2. AKA within 4% of actual US numbers. We were also about 300-400 on July numbers based on a graph released by Tesla. So yeah, we're confident.It's impossible to be 100% accurate.

Moreover, as the end of the month is nearing, we always need to keep in mind that production and deliveries are two very different things.""If you don't like the article that's fine.

0,"new york (reuters) - the sharp slump in tesla inc’s shares this month could unlock massive gains on equity option bets investors placed over the last several months that pay when the electric car maker’s stock slides. a tesla showroom is seen in santa monica, california, u.s., january 4, 2018. reuters/lucy nicholson tesla stock is down close to 27 percent this month, within striking distance of its worst month on record. shares fell 7.7 percent to $257.78 on wednesday, a day after tumbling 8.2 percent to their lowest close in almost a year. tesla was hit by federal probes of a fatal crash on march 23 in california involving one of its vehicles and a downgrade of its credit position by moody’s investors service that cited liquidity pressures and a significant shortfall in model 3 production. as the shares sank, put options that convey the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future have jumped in value. with tesla shares, put options betting on declines below $50, $100 and $200, by mid-january 2019, account for the three largest blocks of open contracts. while tesla’s shares remain far above these strike prices, recent losses have boosted the value of the put options. put options betting on the shares slipping below $50, changed hands on wednesday for $1.93 a contract, up from 43 cents, a month ago. the $50, $100 and $200 puts are all trading at more than double their average trading price over the last three months, according to thomson reuters data. “these puts have actually become something of a running joke on my network with many different people weighing in on why someone would trade a seemingly worthless option,” said mark longo of the options insider, an options commentary website. one explanation could be that firms selling credit default swaps on tesla may be using these puts as a hedge against tesla going bankrupt, longo said. ophir gottlieb, chief executive of los angeles-based capital market laboratories, said he thinks the position is unlikely to be a hedge against a position in the stock, given how far the strike prices are from where tesla shares are trading. “it would be like having a garden hose after a fire has already burnt the house,” gottlieb said. “the distance between the strikes is very particular. half of $200 is $100, half of $100 is $50. that sounds like an aggressive put spreader,” he said. a bear put spread involves buying one set of put contracts and selling another set with the same expiration but at a much lower strike, as a way to offset some of the cost. “if it is a speculator, they are looking for the stock to go well below $200, but not a lot below $100. they are looking for disaster, but not bankruptcy,” gottlieb said. it was not clear if the position was initiated by one trader or several, but thomson reuters data showed that the contracts have steadily grown in number starting around the beginning of 2017. for tesla options in general, elevated levels of volatility and skew - a measure of relative demand for puts versus calls - suggest that options market participants see a rough road ahead for tesla shares, said henry schwartz, president at options analytics firm trade alert in new york. reporting by saqib iqbal ahmed; editing by daniel bases and david gregorio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"kuala lumpur (thomson reuters foundation) - when seah kian hoe was just 10 years old, he would jump on the back of his parent’s small truck during school holidays and help them collect scrap, going door-to-door around neighborhoods in malaysia’s southern state of johor. taking their haul back to the family yard, they would spend hours separating the glass bottles, aluminum cans, discarded newspapers and metal. seah now employs 350 people to help him run heng hiap industries, one of malaysia’s top five plastic recycling businesses which processes about 40,000 tonnes of waste per year from both domestic and overseas suppliers. “thirty five years ago, it was just scavenging - a very different era compared to now,” seah told the thomson reuters foundation. “i wanted to get into the recycling business and do it differently.” heng hiap industries is just one of the southeast asian plastics recycling companies gearing up to benefit from china’s decision to ban imports of plastic waste from the start of 2018. before the ban, which shocked many in the industry, china was the world’s dominant importer of such waste. in 2016, it imported 7.3 million tonnes of waste plastics, valued at $3.7 billion, accounting for 56 percent of world imports. over the past two decades, china was keen to suck in as much plastic waste as possible, helping feed its manufacturing expansion. but policy makers took action after a string of scandals involving unscrupulous players in the waste market. misdemeanors included stuffing containers with mixed or toxic rubbish rather than the specific types labeled for recycling, and illegal smuggling of waste that was simply dumped in landfill. “plastic china”, an award-winning documentary released in late 2016, ignited further public outrage by highlighting the human and environmental costs of the under-regulated, wild west-style recycling industry. as part of efforts to clean up china’s environment, including promoting electric cars and cutting coal use, beijing launched a campaign against harmful “foreign garbage” last year. some of the worst-hit exporters of plastic waste are based in the united states and britain - leaving those two countries scrambling to find alternative places to take their rubbish. “the industry was not prepared for it,” said surendra patawari borad, a businessman who runs a recycling company in belgium and the united states and chairs the plastics committee at the brussels-based bureau of international recycling (bir). “i used to say about europe and the u.s., if china gets a cold, we get a fever, and if china gets a fever, we get pneumonia,” he added. “no complaining” unable to send their plastic waste to china, britain and the united states are now likely to increase their domestic recycling capacities in an effort to reduce exports. but industry officials say this could take years and may still not be enough. “if anyone has a problem selling their scrap plastic right now, they should not be complaining - they should be looking at themselves because this ... has been on the cards for quite a while,” said damien van leuven, founder of vanden global, an international plastics recycling company based in hong kong. faced with growing stockpiles of plastic waste, many british and u.s. companies are either burning some plastics for energy recovery or sending the materials to landfill, several industry researchers told the thomson reuters foundation. both of these methods will have a catastrophic impact on the environment, they warned. “do they (china) care about the global environment or only their own environment because we are land-filling perfectly good materials now because of the actions that they’re taking,” said adina renee adler, senior director for international relations at the institute for scrap recycling industries in washington. the labor-intensive job of taking bales of plastic waste to be broken down, cleaned, separated into different plastic resins and finally made into pellets ready to be reshaped into new products is now expected to fall to southeast asian countries. malaysia, vietnam, indonesia and thailand are among the southeast asian countries that have attracted chinese investors in the plastics recycling sector over the past year, keen to fill the void left in china, industry officials said. most have yet to develop their own domestic recycling collection and public awareness about the issue, but their access to cheap labor and close proximity to china’s manufacturing industries work in their favor. time to regulate preliminary data from the bir, shared with the thomson reuters foundation, showed imports of plastic waste into southeast asia are already rising fast. due partly to a ramp-up in shipments in the final quarter of last year, the bir estimates that annual imports of plastic scrap into malaysia jumped to 450,000-500,000 tonnes in 2017 from 288,000 tonnes in 2016. vietnam’s imports rose by 62 percent to 500,000-550,000 tonnes for 2017, while thailand and indonesia showed increases of up to 117 percent and 65 percent respectively. the industry fears, however, that a flood of unregulated plastic waste to these countries could lead to similar problems as those experienced in china, resulting in copy-cat bans. to avoid this, industry officials urged southeast asian nations to tighten health and safety regulations, so that they can properly monitor what plastics enter their countries, and stop illegal practices. greenpeace east asia plastics campaigner liu hua wants to see companies use less plastic packaging in the longer-term, but for now, southeast asian governments should strengthen environmental controls to limit the spread of hazardous chemical waste and any negative impact on human health, he said. steve wong, executive president of the china scrap plastics association, called for stronger controls on imports, license issuance and environmental inspections of factories. to date, the world has produced more than 8 billion tonnes of plastic, said borad at the bir. only 9 percent has been recycled, while just under 80 percent has been treated as waste - sent to landfill sites or dumped in the oceans. as awareness rises over the dangers of allowing plastic waste to end up in the sea where it poisons fish and can enter the human food chain, recycling capacity will need to grow considerably worldwide. in malaysia, seah remembers how his parents were once ashamed they made a living from collecting and reusing scrap, believing it to be a profession that was not respected. but when his recycling company received an international award for environmental leadership in 2013, it helped change their minds. southeast asian nations now face a similar battle to shift perceptions of the recycling industry. “i don’t believe there is a global plastics pollution problem - there is a global plastics ignorance problem,” said seah. “it is a substance with a lot of hidden values.” reporting by michael taylor, editing by megan rowling; please credit the thomson reuters foundation, the charitable arm of thomson reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience. visit news.trust.org",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"beijing (reuters) - nissan motor co plans to invest 60 billion yuan ($9.5 billion) in china over the next five years with its joint-venture partner as it seeks to become a top three automaker in the world’s biggest market. long stuck as a second-tier player in china, nissan and dongfeng group said on monday they plan to boost their volume to 2.6 million vehicles a year by 2022, up from 1.5 million vehicles last year. nissan plans to achieve the objective, dubbed its “triple one” strategy, by focusing on electric cars and venucia, a no-frills local brand nissan operates in china - two market segments expected to see a surge in demand. it also aims to boost sales of light commercial vans and trucks. china’s auto market has been dominated by general motors co and volkswagen ag for nearly two decades, with each of them selling 4 million vehicles last year. nissan, along with toyota motor corp , ford motor co, and honda motor co, lag far behind, each selling 1 million-plus vehicles a year. “we aim to break away from this second-tier group and become a top-3 china automaker,” nissan’s china chief jun seki said in an interview with reuters. “we need to go full-throttle aggressive,” seki said. “if we didn’t do that, we would fall behind and fail to grab market share otherwise we could take.” electric strategy part of the strategy is to keep growing the nissan brand and the company’s premium infiniti brand, seki said. nissan and dongfeng plan to increase the nissan brand’s annual sales by 500,000 vehicles to 1.6 million vehicles a year by 2022. it also plans to boost infiniti’s annual sales by 100,000 vehicles to about 150,000 vehicles a year over the same time frame. still, more critical a strategy is nissan’s electrification plan. seki said the joint venture will launch as many as 20 electrified vehicle models across all brands in an effort to sell roughly 700,000 such cars a year by 2022 excluding electric light commercial vehicles, using a combination of all-electric battery vehicles and so-called “e-power” hybrids. file photo: a venucia t90 from dongfeng nissan is shown at china (guangzhou) international automobile exhibition in guangzhou, china november 18, 2016. reuters/bobby yip/file photo automakers are scrambling to launch an array of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles over the coming years, in part to comply with china’s production quotas for such cars. nissan’s joint venture with dongfeng sold about 22,000 electric vehicles last year, but they were mostly light commercial e-vans. in order to generate large enough ev volume, nissan plans to come up with lower-cost electric cars by locally sourcing electric motors and other key ev components from suppliers in china. in 2019, nissan for example plans to launch three such lower-cost evs under the venucia name. “we expect ev and e-power hybrid business to become profitable,” seki said, without elaborating. no-frills venucia, which nissan established jointly with dongfeng, is another key focus. the brand began selling cars in 2012, competing with china’s low-cost, no-frills indigenous brands such as those run by geely and great wall motor. seki said shoring up venucia is a must because indigenous chinese brands will likely collectively sell as many cars as global brands sell in china. last year indigenous chinese brands sold a total of 10.3 million vehicles, compared with global brands’ 13.9 million vehicles. venucia, which uses retired nissan technologies such as platforms and transmissions, last year sold 143,000 vehicles, up 22.7 percent from 2016. seki said nissan wants to boost venucia’s annual volume by more than 400,000 vehicles to be able to sell as many as 600,000 vehicles a year by 2022. the effort is likely to face tough competition, however, from established local players such as baojun, which gm operates jointly with its local china partners. “no global automakers have a brand that competes with low-cost local brands except for us and gm,” seki said. in addition to baojun, gm operates the wuling brand in a joint venture with chinese partner saic motor corp and guangxi automobile group. “venucia is our clear advantage and we are going to milk it to grow rapidly,” seki said. reporting by norihiko shirouzu; editing by lincoln feast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"toronto--(business wire)-- sherritt international corporation : not for distribution to united states newswire services or for dissemination in the united states sherritt international corporation (“sherritt” or the “corporation”) (tsx: s), a world leader in the mining and hydrometallurgical refining of nickel and cobalt from lateritic ores, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2017. all amounts are in canadian currency unless noted. ceo commentary “sherritt ended 2017 with a significantly strengthened balance sheet and a much improved outlook as a result of a number of key developments over the past year,” said david pathe, president and ceo of sherritt international. “most notably, we completed the restructuring of the ambatovy joint venture, achieved our nickel and cobalt production as well as our unit cost targets at the moa joint venture, and benefitted from higher realized prices for each of the primary commodities that we produce.” mr. pathe added, “we have sustained this momentum since the start of 2018 with our first equity financing in more than a decade, and are currently conducting a modified dutch auction tender process to reduce our debt even further. with the strong outlook for class 1 nickel and cobalt given electric vehicle market trends and the maturities on our outstanding debentures not due until the fourth quarter of 2021, we are particularly encouraged by our prospects in 2018 and beyond.” q4 highlights sherritt and its partners successfully completed the restructuring of the ambatovy joint venture. following the restructuring, sherritt eliminated $1.4 billion in debt from its balance sheet, retained a 12% ownership interest in ambatovy and continues to serve as operator. net direct cash cost (ndcc) (1) at the moa joint venture (“moa jv”) was us$1.80 per pound of finished nickel sold, the lowest total since the third quarter of 2004. the decline was primarily driven by higher cobalt prices and the us$0.50 per pound cost savings achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at moa in the fourth quarter of 2016. sherritt’s share of finished nickel production at the moa jv was 4,134 tonnes, up 9% from q4 2016, while its share of finished cobalt was 465 tonnes, up 22% from q4 2016. production increased on a year-over-year basis despite the negative impact heavy rains had on lowering mixed sulphide production in november and december 2017. received $19.9 million from the moa jv as repayment on its working capital facility and us$7.5 million in cuban energy payments. adjusted ebitda was $49.6 million, up 33% from q4 2016. including a gain of $629.0 million related to the ambatovy restructuring, earnings were $537.8 million, or $1.80 per share outstanding, up from a net loss of $106.7 million, or $0.36 per share outstanding, in q4 2016. 2017 highlights sherritt ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $203.0 million after reflecting payments related to the ambatovy jv restructuring, interest payments related to outstanding debentures and the $35.0 million repayment of a syndicated revolving-term loan. sherritt’s share of finished nickel and finished cobalt production at the moa jv were 15,762 tonnes and 1,801 tonnes, respectively. the production totals were in line with guidance for the year. ndcc at the moa joint venture was us$2.35 per pound of finished nickel, below the us$2.80 - $3.30 per pound guidance that the company provided for the year. adjusted ebitda was $149.8 million, up from $40.0 million in 2016. including the gain related to the ambatovy jv restructuring, net earnings were $293.8 million, or $0.99 per share outstanding, up from a net loss of $378.9 million, or $1.29 per share outstanding, in 2016. sherritt’s efforts to strengthen its balance sheet were reflected in a number of improved financial ratios at year end. net debt to adjusted ebitda reduced from 48.9 at the end 2016 to 4.4 at december 31, 2017 while total debt to shareholders’ equity improved from 2.1 at the end of 2016 to 0.8 at december 31, 2017. (2) highlights subsequent to year end closed a unit offering financing transaction that generated gross proceeds of $132.0 million. net proceeds will be used to reduce sherritt’s outstanding indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and to fund future growth initiatives. launched a modified dutch auction tender offer to repurchase up to $75.0 million of outstanding unsecured debentures. the tender offering is expected to close on february 16, 2017. executed a three-year extension of the puerto escondido/yumuri production sharing contract to 2021. although facilities at the ambatovy joint venture in madagascar were impacted by tropical cyclone ava, a category 2 hurricane equivalent storm, all personnel were unhurt and safely accounted for. damage to equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in production. repairs have since been completed and partial production has resumed. a ramp up in production is expected through the end of q2 2018.

the first six months of the year. the average nickel reference price in the fourth quarter was us$5.25 per pound, up 7% from us$4.90 for q4 2016. the average nickel reference price for the 12-months of 2017 was us$4.72 per pound, up 8% from us$4.36 per pound for 2016. the year-over-year price improvements were largely driven by the growing understanding of the important role that class 1 nickel will play in the burgeoning electric vehicle (ev) market. class 1 nickel, along with cobalt, are key elements needed to manufacture ev batteries. demand for class 1 nickel and cobalt are expected to grow significantly beginning in 2019 when china expects to begin production quotas requiring that 10% of all vehicles manufactured be electric. during q4, the nickel price was supported by news that nickel pig iron (npi) producers in china were asked to reduce production to alleviate pollution with china’s largest npi-only producer ordered to halve production from november 2017 to march 2018. actual and anticipated reductions from existing nickel producers also continued to help underpin the nickel price, with nickel supply expected to be in a deficit for 2018 and 2019. nickel reference price improvements in the second half were also driven by the decline in inventories. combined lme and shfe nickel inventories at year-end declined to 410,828 tonnes (from 464,696 tonnes at the beginning of the year). any further decline in visible inventories could give momentum to nickel price increases in the future. cobalt cobalt prices strengthened considerably in 2017. the average reference price in the fourth quarter was us$31.60 per pound for 2017, up 134% from q4 2016. the average reference cobalt price for the 12-month period of 2017 was us$26.53, up 125% from us$11.77 per pound for 2016. the price increase is primarily linked to the growing strong demand emanating from the ev battery market. the double-digit price growth experienced over the past year was also driven by geopolitical and supply risk concerns given that the democratic republic of congo is currently the world’s largest source of cobalt. as cobalt prices have a limited impact on overall battery pack costs, high prices are not expected to cause supply-chain disruptions or delay ev market growth. as a result, the risk of cobalt substitution in ev battery production in the near term is relatively low given cobalt’s unique energy transference properties. while battery manufacturers continue to explore alternatives to cobalt, the likely beneficiary of any substitution is expected to be class 1 nickel. cobalt supply deficits are expected to continue over the next few years. in addition to demand from industrial end users, speculative investors are also driving up cobalt prices by stockpiling inventory, further exacerbating supply deficit concerns. moa joint venture (50% interest) and fort site (100%) the moa jv produced 4,134 tonnes of finished nickel in q4 2017, up from 3,782 tonnes produced in q4 2016, despite mixed sulphides production being negatively impacted by abnormally heavy rainfalls in november and december 2017. finished nickel production on a 12-month basis was 15,679 tonnes in 2017, in line with expectations for the year. q4 2017 revenue for the moa jv and the fort site totaled $123.0 million, up 32% from $92.5 million last year. the growth was driven by higher production and higher realized prices for nickel, cobalt and fertilizer. nickel sales represented 50% of total q4 2017 revenue while cobalt sales represented 33%. fertilizer sales in q4 2017 were up 19% from last year, reflecting stronger demand and higher realized prices. mining, processing and refining (mpr) costs for q4 2017 were us$4.89 per pound, down from us$4.93 per pound for q4 2016. the decline was largely due to higher production volumes in q4 2017. mpr costs on the full-year basis were us$4.80 per pound for 2017, up from us$4.63 per pound for 2016. the us$0.17 increase per pound in 2017 was attributable to higher energy costs, although partly offset by cost savings of approximately us$0.50 per pound achieved with the commissioning of the third acid plant at moa in the fourth quarter of 2016. despite higher energy and sulphur input costs, moa’s ndcc of us$1.80/lb of finished nickel in q4 2017 was the lowest experienced since q3 2004. the cobalt credit of us$3.54/lb reflects moa’s high cobalt to nickel production ratio as well as the 125% growth in cobalt prices since q4 2016. ndcc improvement also benefited from the commissioning of a third sulphuric acid plant at moa in 2016 that generated approximate savings of us$0.50/lb. ndcc on a 12-month basis was $2.35/lb, down from $3.42/lb for 2016. ndcc for 2017 was significantly lower than expectations for the year, due largely to higher cobalt by-product credits. cash provided by operations in q4 2017 totaled $32.5 million, up from a loss in q4 2016 when hurricane matthew and the subsequent collapse of bridge infrastructure negatively impacted production. cash flow from operations in q4 2017 was also positively impacted higher realized nickel and cobalt prices.. moa’s sustaining capital spending in q4 2017 was $7.7 million, up from $4.7 million in q4 last year. the increase was attributable to the timing of expenditures. ambatovy joint venture (12% interest effective december 11, 2017) along with its partners, sherritt completed the restructuring of the ambatovy joint venture on december 11, 2017. the restructuring led to sherritt’s ownership interest being reduced to 12% in exchange for the elimination of $1.4 billion of debt. sherritt’s financial and operational results at ambatovy are presented on a 40% basis to december 10, 2017 and on a 12% basis effective december 11, 2017. sherritt will continue to serve as operator of ambatovy at least through 2024, however, as a result of the reduction in its ownership interest, sherritt’s ability to direct local decision-making at ambatovy has diminished. finished nickel production at ambatovy in q4 2017 was 3,111 tonnes, down from 5,111 tonnes for the comparable period of 2016, which represented ambatovy’s highest ever production total. the year-over-year decline was due to a number of developments that impacted plant reliability. most notably, the failure of an economizer in one of the acid plants reduced production capacity to approximately 50% during november and december of 2017. finished nickel production on a 12-month basis for 2017 was 13,618 tonnes, down from 16,842 tonnes for 2016. the year-over-year decline was primarily due to equipment failures that reduced the reliability of ambatovy’s acid plant and pressure acid leach circuit. maintenance activities and replacement of equipment completed in 2017 are expected to improve plant reliability and production stability over time. finished cobalt production in q4 2017 was 245 tonnes, down from 404 tonnes for the same period of 2016. the decrease was tied to plant reliability issues previously cited that lowered production. cobalt production for 2017 was 1,173 tonnes, down from 1,309 tonnes for 2016. mpr costs for q4 2017 were us$5.76 per pound, up from us$3.97 per pound in q4 2016. mpr costs on a full-year basis were us$6.01 per pound in 2017, up from us$4.89 per pound in 2016. the year-over-year increases were largely due to higher input costs as well as lower production volumes in 2017. ndcc for finished nickel at ambatovy in q4 2017 was $3.26/lb, up from the $3.10/lb for q4 2016. the increase was due to lower production, higher maintenance costs, higher energy and sulphur input costs offset by higher cobalt by-product credits. ndcc on a 12-month basis $3.83/lb for 2017, down from $4.27/lb for 2016. ambatovy’s ndcc for 2017 places it slightly above the 50 th percentile of industry average cost. subsequent to year end, facilities at the ambatovy joint venture were impacted by tropical cyclone ava, a category 2 hurricane equivalent storm. damage to equipment and the acid production facilities resulted in a temporary halt in production. repairs have since been completed and partial production has resumed. a ramp up in production is expected through the end of q2 2018. oil and gas for the three months ended for the years ended 2017 2016 2017 2016 $ millions, except as otherwise noted december

(3) spending on capital includes accruals. power production in q4 2017 was 201 gigawatt hours (“gwh”) of electricity, down 10% from 224 gwh for the comparable period of 2016. the decline was largely due to reduced gas supply. power production on a 12-month basis was 848 gwh for 2017, down from 894 gwh for 2016. average realized prices in q4 2017 declined to $54.01 per megawatt hour (“mwh’) of electricity from $56.24 per mwh in q4 2016. the decline was due to the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the u.s. currency. revenue in q4 2017 totaled $12.0 million, down 15% from $13.7 million for q4 2016. the decrease is attributable to lower production and lower realized prices. revenue on a full-year basis was $51.2 million, down from $58.6 million for 2016. cash flow from operations in q4 2017 grew by 264% to $5.3 million due to changes in working capital in the quarter. unit operating cost in q4 2017 was $23.43 per mwh of electricity, down 5% from $24.73 per mwh for q4 2016. the decrease was due principally to reduced maintenance activities at the boca and puerto escondido facilities this year. total capital spending in q4 2017 was $0.1 million, down from $0.4 million for the comparable period of last year. for the full year, the decline in capital spending was primarily due to the absence of service concession spending this year. 2017 review of strategic

based on results from first two wells drilled on block 10 the results from the first well have provided constructive data to optimize the drilling of the second well, again targeting the lower veloz formation. drilling on the second well at block 10 has been temporarily suspended to determine the best option to reach the target reservoir. drilling results from the second well are expected in q3 2018. uphold global operational leadership in finished nickel laterite production further reduce ndcc at moa and ambatovy towards the goal of achieving or remaining in the lowest quartile of global nickel cash costs q4 ndcc of us$1.80/lb at the moa jv is the lowest since q3 2004. moa’s ndcc ranked it within the lowest cost quartile for the third consecutive quarter. ambatovy’s ndcc of us$3.83/lb for 2017 marked an improvement from last year, but was below expectations due to lower production and higher maintenance costs. increase ambatovy production and predictability over 2016 ambatovy production in 2017 experienced a number of unanticipated challenges and resulted in several unplanned maintenance activities. initiatives, such as replacing certain equipment, are being implemented to improve asset reliability. achieve peer leading performance in environmental, health, safety and sustainability in 2017, sherritt joined the mining association of canada (mac) and began implementing mac’s towards sustainable mining program, an internationally recognized sustainability standard. in safety, sherritt met its recordable incident frequency target, but exceeded its injury frequency

1,"stuttgart (reuters) - daimler’s profit growth will be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles, it said on thursday, as it missed quarterly earnings forecasts and reported a lower margin on its mercedes-benz cars. an expected rise in unit sales and revenue in 2018 will be countered by spending on new cars and technologies, the german automaker said, forecasting earnings before interest and tax (ebit) would come in at a similar level to 2017. evercore isi analyst arndt ellinghorst said daimler’s results and guidance flagged investment and exchange rate challenges likely to hit profitability across the industry. “of course we are aware of many of these burdens, but to see it black and white is still shocking,” said ellinghorst. daimler said it faced currency headwinds, partly from a stronger euro, of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2018, as well as 200 million euros in extra raw material costs and a further 1 billion euros in investments to “secure the future.” ellinghorst calculated this could amount to an additional 300-400 million euros in extra restructuring costs and a rise of up to 700 million euros in research and development spending. “daimler is not alone. it will be harder for all companies to maintain their profitability,” said ellinghorst, who has an “outperform” rating on daimler shares. most major carmakers are ramping up spending on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies, as well as services such as car-sharing, amid tightening emissions regulations and competition from the likes of uber and google. the mercedes star logo of an e coupe is pictured before the annual news conference of daimler ag in stuttgart, germany, february 2, 2017. reuters/michaela rehle daimler’s ebit for the fourth quarter through december was flat at 3.47 billion euros, missing the average forecast of 3.65 billion euros in a reuters poll. the return on sales at its mercedes-benz cars division shrank to 9.7 percent from an unusually high 10.7 percent a year earlier, even as unit sales rose by 4 percent. file photo: the mercedes star logo of an eq concept car is pictured before the annual news conference of daimler ag in stuttgart, germany, february 2, 2017. reuters/michaela rehle /file photo this year, mercedes-benz will post a slight rise in unit sales and flat ebit at its cars division, daimler forecast, while operating profit at the vans business will dip, with the costs of launching a pickup truck offsetting higher unit sales. despite a continued rise in demand for cars in china this year, daimler said it expected more moderate demand in the first months of this year. it also said it had set aside 3 billion euros toward its german pension plan. related coverage daimler may give more info on divisions in overhaul it will pay a dividend of 3.65 euros a share for 2017, compared with analysts’ consensus forecast for 3.53 euros. shares in stuttgart-based daimler were flat at 0855 gmt, recovering from initial decline, but still underperformed a 0.6 percent rise by the german blue-chip dax index.

0,"frankfurt (reuters) - germany’s bmw has bought out partner sixt from their joint venture drivenow, paving the way for a broader car-sharing and driverless taxi alliance with daimler to compete against the likes of uber and lyft. car rental company sixt said on monday it would generate an extraordinary pre-tax profit of about 200 million euros ($248 million) in 2018 from the sale of the drivenow stake to bmw for 209 million euros. “with drivenow as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we have all options for continued strategic development of our services,” peter schwarzenbauer, bmw’s board member for digital business innovation, said. “our experience with mobility services supports our development of future autonomous, electrified and connected fleets,” he said, adding that bmw aims to have 100 million customers for “premium mobility services” by 2025. the sixt deal comes as bmw moves closer to agreeing a deal to combine its car-sharing services with daimler’s car2go, a person familiar with the discussions told reuters last week. the german carmakers want to build a joint business which includes car sharing, ride-hailing, electric vehicle charging, and digital parking services, a senior executive at one of the companies said on monday. mercedes-benz parent daimler and bmw declined comment on the status of potential talks on their car-sharing business. “this is speculation, we do not comment,” bmw said. the senior executive, who declined to be named because the plan is not public, said: “this will create an ecosystem which can also be used for managing robotaxi (driverless taxi) fleets.” bmw would contribute its parknow and chargenow businesses to the common company, the executive said, adding that there were still differences of opinion over the valuation of car2go. the market for ride-hailing services currently makes up around 33 percent of the global taxi market, and could grow eightfold to $285 billion by 2030, once autonomous robotaxis are in operation, goldman sachs said in a recent research note. bmw and daimler are now working on developing autonomous cars, vehicles which could enable them to up-end the market for taxi and ride-hailing services.

1,"by kirsten korosec march 6, 2018  jaguar land rover has priced its first all-electric vehicle, a sporty looking 2019 i-pace crossover sport utility vehicle, at $69,500 in the u.s. market, a base cost that puts it $10,000 below the standard tesla model x.  jaguar unveiled the 2019 i-pace march 2 ahead of the international geneva motor show. at the time, the british brand announced pricing of 63,495 pounds ($87,152) in the uk. (the uk price includes 20% valued added tax, while u.s. prices are listed pre-tax.)  the lower u.s. pricing will certainly help jaguar remain competitive in the luxury electric vehicle market, which has been dominated by tesla for several years. however, the jaguar i-pace and tesla model x aren’t exactly equal competitors.  the model x is larger, seating seven people, while the jaguar i-pace seats five. the tesla model x also has different battery pack sizes, which for a pricey upgrade gets owners up to 295 miles to a single charge. tesla also has a growing network of fast-chargers called superchargers that are located on u.s. highways in an effort to promote long-distance travel.  jaguar land rover is intent on catching up. the company has committed to invest $1.5 billion on new facilities and enhanced owner experiences over the next five years in north america. there are 207 total dealerships in the united states, including 166 jaguar franchises, which have started installing electric vehicle charging equipment to prepare for the i-pace.  retailers are also investing in training their sales and service personnel to better understand the electric vehicle market. it’s a critical step that other automakers and their dealership networks have failed to do correctly, depressing sales of hybrid and electric vehicles.  the vehicle will hit u.s. dealerships in the second half of the year as a 2019 model in three trim levels, the s, se, and hse versions. a first edition model in the hse will also be available. sponsored financial content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"* volumes in supply deal to drop by 25-50 percent * rusal wants to boost value-added component to 50-52 pct in 2018 * rusal bets on asian construction, technology boom by dmitry zhdannikov and polina devitt london/moscow, feb 27 (reuters) - mining giant glencore’s deal to buy aluminium from rusal will be renewed from 2019, but the tonnage is likely to be much lower as the russian producer taps into growing demand for value-added products, two sources close to the matter said. unless it sources from additional suppliers, the reduction in volume will weaken the leading position held for years by swiss-based glencore in the global aluminium market. rusal, controlled by billionaire oleg deripaska and co-owned by glencore, is expected to cut the volume in any new deal by 25-50 percent from the 14.5 million tonnes that covers the seven years from 2012 to 2018. the deal was valued at $47 billion in 2012. the new arrangement is likely to last a number of years although the exact duration is not yet clear, sources said. glencore owns 8.75 percent of rusal, the world’s second-largest aluminium producer after china’s hongqiao . “rusal simply doesn’t have the same amount of primary aluminium it used to have in 2012 due to its focus on value-added products,” said a senior source, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are not public. glencore declined to comment. a rusal spokesman said: “we don’t comment on any individual customer business, however, we are committed to pursuing our strategy to expand the share of value-added product sales to 60 percent by 2021.” aluminium, a light metal valued for its strength, is widely used in transport and packaging. rusal’s output of value-added products - from slabs and billets to wire rods - has climbed in recent years, reaching 47 percent of its overall output last year from below 40 percent in 2012. the company plans to boost the value-added product component to 50-52 percent of aluminium sales this year and 60 percent by 2021 with new investment at its siberian plants in krasnoyarsk and khakas. hong kong-listed rusal said it sees growing demand, especially in asia ahead of the tokyo 2020 olympics and as china expands its transport, construction and computer industries. rusal, part of the power, auto and metals conglomerate en+, also believes it is positioned to benefit from the boom in electric vehicles (evs) as it produces power, aluminium for lighter cars as well as nickel, cobalt and lithium for ev batteries through its co-ownership in norilsk nickel. “if you take an ev and break it down into components and if you take en+ plus and break it down into components - those components will almost match,” en+ president maxim sokov told reuters last month at the world economic forum in davos. “the ev revolution will require a huge power-charging infrastructure. that requires a lot of aluminium and a lot of wire rods. we have been working on aluminium products which can rival copper in terms of conductivity.” global aluminium production is forecast at around 65 million tonnes this year, of which glencore will control about 4-5 million tonnes. the rusal deal contributes around half of glencore’s aluminium portfolio. deripaska and glencore boss ivan glasenberg, long-time allies, have faced multiple shareholding battles that rocked rusal and norilsk. the russian firms could be heading for another crisis as billionaire co-owner viktor vekselberg battles for more control of rusal. vekselberg’s investment firm in 2012 filed an unsuccessful lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal between rusal and glencore, saying it was against the interest of all shareholders. a spokesman for vekselberg declined to comment on whether the co-owner would support any new supply deal.

0,"may 23, 2018 / 7:25 am / updated 39 minutes ago israel's defence expertise drives tech boom for autonomous cars tova cohen , steven scheer 8 min read shfayim, israel (reuters) - technology that has helped israel’s military drive tanks, guide and intercept missiles, and keep its computer systems secure is being redeployed in the development of driverless cars. a kia soul, modified as an autonomous vehicle by the imagry startup company, is seen ahead of a driving demonstration near shfayim, israel april 17, 2018. picture taken april 17, 2018. reuters/nir elias investment from firms seeking access to israeli expertise in automated driving, much of it gathered by engineers during their conscription, is pouring into startups. u.s. chipmaker intel ( intc.o ), german auto supplier continental ( cong.de ), samsung ( 005930.ks ), daimler ( daign.de ), ford motor co ( f.n ) and gm ( gm.n ) are among those to have bought startups or set up their own development centres in israel. inexperience in car-making, distance from traditional auto centres and competition from other tech sectors for top staff are a challenge for investors. israeli auto tech startups still raised almost as much as similar u.s. companies last year. “a lot of the entrepreneurs are coming out of the israel defence forces and they tend to be older than the traditional silicon valley (entrepreneurs),” ford executive chairman bill ford jr. told reuters. “they have a lot of judgment and wisdom. particularly in areas like cybersecurity, there’s tremendous activity coming out of israel.” the united states attracts the most investment in the sector with companies raising $1.2 billion last year, according to venture capital data provider cb insights. silicon valley, pittsburgh and detroit are making efforts to be leaders in the driverless car era. israeli auto tech startups are not far behind. they raised $814 million last year, triple the 2015 level, and $182 million in the first quarter of 2018, in line with last year’s pace, according to start-up nation central. investment in israeli autotech including venture capital, acquisitions and joint ventures, totalled $3.5 billion in 2017, said micki shapira, a partner at law firm weinstock zecler & co. startups elsewhere are making a push. beijing has emerged as a hot spot, with strong backing from the chinese government. but israel’s innovation, often in elite military departments such as the cyber intelligence unit 8200, wireless sensors, security, location finding and analytics software means it is well positioned to rival silicon valley. cybersecurity expertise ensures that the computers of driverless cars keep hackers out while radar, sonar, sensors and positioning systems are used to keep the cars on the road and stop them crashing into other vehicles or objects. cyber and fraud detection techniques are rooted in counterterrorism while breakthroughs in optical and sonar software may stem from missile defence, said evercore isi analyst chris mcnally. slideshow (7 images) test drive on an empty highway built by israel’s government to test self-driving cars near shfayim, north of tel aviv, a samsung-backed startup called imagry last month demonstrated its technology on a modified kia soul. the five-seater, equipped with cameras, infrared and artificial intelligence, kept a safe distance from another car. autonomy - without relying on the expensive laser detection system known as lidar which waymo and gm use - has become a quest for the industry. “cameras provide the most high resolution information and they are available and commoditised,” said imagry’s chief executive officer (ceo) adham ghazali. his goal is to produce cheaper technology than lidar. another samsung-backed startup, innoviz, whose ceo spent 7 years in an elite technological unit of the idf’s intelligence corps, wants to lower the cost of lidar rather than replace it. together with partner magna ( mg.to ) it signed a deal last month to supply lidar to bmw ( bmwg.de ). innoviz raised $73 million in 201. with full autonomy - a market ubs estimates will be worth up to $2.3 trillion in 2030 - a long way off, ghazali aims to have 20 robotaxis operating in israel and the united states next year at “level 4” autonomy with a safety driver present. israel’s auto tech sector started to take off in 2014, the year after google bought mapping firm waze for $1.2 billion. another big step was when intel spent $15.3 billion on autonomous vehicle technology firm mobileye last year and moved all its operations in the field to jerusalem. “we were not known as a country that provides technology to the automotive industry and suddenly you have more than 500 different startups dealing with ... the automotive industry,” mobileye co-founder ziv aviram said. german auto supplier continental ( cong.de ) bought cybersecurity firm argus, whose ceo was a captain in unit 8200, for about $430 million last year. samsung’s harman unit acquired cyber firm towersec for $75 million in 2016. renault-nissan-mitsubishi ( rena.pa ) 7201.ta ( 7211.t ), vw ( vowg.de ), porsche ( pshg_p.de ) and honda ( 7267.t ) also have interests in israel. “we are going to do more here,” said nick sugimoto, head of honda innovations. competing for staff the government is keen to support the sector. it is building a simulator for test drives and working on regulation to balance safety with innovation, said gil shaki, head of energy, cleantech and transport at the innovation authority. but there are still challenges for auto companies dealing with israeli startups. “you don’t have tremendous knowledge about how to take a technology that’s in a nascent state and take it down the path...to automotive grade,” said glen de vos, chief technology officer of aptiv, a major automotive supplier that is developing safety and autonomous driving systems. the startups are sometimes surprised that it can take five years to get a product launched on a car, and a decade to achieve significant sales volume, he said. distance from other car centres can also be a problem. “it’s harder to get there,” said de vos, who is based in silicon valley. a challenge for the startups is the competition for staff with giant international firms such as google or intel. the government forecasts a shortage of 10,000 engineers and programmers over the next decade in the tech sector in general which already employs 270,000. many of the startups pivoted to autos from other fields. storedot, which raised $60 million from daimler in september and another $20 million from bp ( bp.l ) on tuesday, developed a super-fast charger for cellphones before switching to automotives. the company, valued at $750 million according to startup marketplace funderbeam, says its batteries can fully charge an electric vehicle in five minutes. “both are big markets but we tend to think the electric vehicle market will be much bigger,” said erez lorber, chief operating officer of storedot. arbe robotics, which has roots in the military and homeland security, built radar for drones before moving into cars, said ceo kobi merenko. interest in the sector has pushed up valuations, said yifat oron, ceo of bank leumi’s tech arm leumitech. if a startup in an early fundraising round once raised $3-$5 million, it could now get $20 million and hundreds of millions of dollars at later stages. “there’s always overexcitement as happened with the cybersecurity sector,” she said. “maybe it will be corrected a little but we can’t see this happening in the near or mid-term.” additional reporting by ari rabinovitch in jerusalem, eric auchard in london and joe white and paul lienert in detroit; editing by anna willard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"Hi,So I remain curious about the two, standard range, Model 3:(5.3-5.6) / 5.3 = -5.7% slower acceleration(240 - 220) / 240 = -8.3% shorter range(140 - 130) / 140 = -7.1% slower top speedThese numbers suggest the differences are aerodynamic. The loss of range, -8.3%, and top speed, -7.1%, are conducted at higher average speeds where aerodynamic drag plays a bigger role. In contrast, the -5.7% acceleration occurs with significantly lower speeds, 0 mph to 60 mph. Speculations:rear spoiler missingunderbody liner missingfixed open air inletwheel covers (aka., hub caps)I can't rule out higher rolling drag tires. But these tend to be speed independent and the range of -5.7% to -8.3% is a little too wide of range to be just tires.There could be a control law designed to reduce drive train efficiency.

1,"is elon musk worth a $2.6 billion compensation package ?  tesla’s shareholders will answer that question wednesday, as the board seeks their approval to give chief executive officer musk an unprecedented 10-figure award of stock options.  the package—arguably the largest-ever of its kind—underscores the company’s outsize ambitions and how intimately connected its future success is to musk. if the plan’s accepted and he turns tesla into both a mass-market automaker and one of the world’s largest companies, he’ll become perhaps the richest man on the planet.  votes on the compensation plan will be cast at a special shareholder meeting in fremont, calif., at 9 a.m. local time. the board needs support from investors holding a majority of the shares—not counting those owned by musk and his brother kimbal, who’s a tesla director—to make the award. proxy advisory firms institutional shareholder services and glass lewis & co. have urged investors to vote against the package , while large shareholders baillie gifford & co. and t. rowe price group have signaled they’re likely to support it.  under the proposed terms, musk would earn one-12th of the options every time tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. for musk to get all the options, tesla would have to become worth $650 billion—more than facebook—and produce more revenue than procter & gamble .  here are some of the main pros and cons shareholders will be mulling as they cast their ballots: pro: investors (and musk) might reap massive gains  tesla has said in regulatory filings that musk’s award could yield him more than $50 billion if all goals are achieved. that’s an astronomical sum, compared to what other u.s. executives make. still, musk will reap gains only if shareholders do, too. some large investors have said the package aligns with their interests, signaling they don’t mind if musk gets wealthier, as long as they also see big returns. con: musk already owns about 20% of tesla. does he really need more money?  more than half of musk’s roughly $20 billion fortune is tied up in tesla stock. that’s led some to question whether the largest award in corporate history is needed to make sure he remains focused on the business. pro: musk got a similar award in 2012, and it was a success  about six years ago, tesla gave the ceo a big bundle of stock options worth roughly $78 million at the time. he could realize gains from those only if tesla met certain product development milestones and drastically increased its market value, and it has: tesla celebrated delivery of its 250,000th car in the third quarter. tesla’s market cap has grown about 16-fold, and musk’s award has ballooned in value to more than $1 billion. con: the award could be hugely expensive and dilutive  large stock awards can be costly for investors in two ways: they increase a company’s expenses and they dilute the stakes of existing shareholders. if musk is successful, tesla’s investors might feel the effects of both. pro: it signals big ambitions  it’s unlikely tesla could hit the top market value threshold of $650 billion solely by selling electric cars. as a result, the award indicates that musk has other ideas for the company, including transforming energy storage through utility-grade applications and the kinds of future-of-mobility plans outlined in his master plan, part deux. con: it doesn’t show how or when tesla will be profitable  musk’s 2012 award depended on the company successfully building and mass-producing electric cars while simultaneously growing its market value. the new grant outlines an aspiration of making tesla one of the world’s biggest companies but without any clues about how the company will get there. the plan also doesn’t offer any indication as to when tesla will have its first-ever profitable fiscal year. pro: it will keep musk close to tesla  musk is also the ceo of space exploration technologies corp. and has embarked on several other projects of late, including tunnel digger boring co. and a brain-computer interface startup called neuralink. that’s led to concerns he’s looking to lessen his involvement with tesla. but the new award binds him to the company for a decade, requiring him to remain either ceo or executive chairman and chief product officer. con: it underscores tesla’s reliance on musk  if musk were to leave, it would be a huge blow, the company has repeatedly told investors in regulatory filings. the big award further emphasizes how integral the board thinks the ceo is to tesla’s future. several top executives have left the company lately, calling into question what tesla would do if musk decided to do something else. pro: it’s the only pay he’s gonna get  the big award aside, tesla’s board has said musk won’t receive any other compensation to underscore that he’ll win only if shareholders do, too. the company is required by california state law to pay him a minimum-wage salary that adds up to roughly $37,000 per year, but musk has never accepted it. sponsored financial content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"new york, january 16, 2018 /prnewswire/ -- the lithium industry could be in for a big m&a consolidation in 2018. lithium x energy corp. (tsx-v: lix) (otc: lixxf) ended 2018 with an announcement of a definitive agreement with nextview new energy lion acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares and warrants of lithium x. other junior and major lithium miners to potentially keep a close eye on are standard lithium ltd. (tsx-v: sll) (otc: stlhf) (fra: s5l) ( stlhf profile ), nemaska lithium inc. (tsx: nmx) (otc: nmkef), nrg metals inc. (tsx-v: ngz) , and lithium americas corp. (tsx: lac) (otc: lacdf) . as reported by forbes, u.s. electric vehicle sales jumped by a record 37 percent in 2016 ( http://nnw.fm/0bl77 ), adding ev companies into an already-strained space and putting lithium supply and demand at an even greater imbalance, with supply for lithium already having trouble supporting the needs of the laptop and smartphone industries. according to an interview with chris berry, president and founder of house mountain partners llc, an energy and natural resource research company, 2018 will be the year of consolidation for the lithium market. this could be in the form of some of the more junior mining companies joining forces to amp-up production or even the major mining companies coming together to work on evolving technologies and improving techniques to increase the production of lithium. consolidation in this manner will help to add a long-term supply of lithium. as lithium production companies begin to join forces, the market will become more aggressive: companies that once had a multitude of focuses will begin to zero in and focus solely on lithium. this will help to create a pure play lithium market that is better equipped to handle the increasing demand for lithium that will result from the growing ev industry. as companies grow through consolidation, their grip on the lithium market will expand and their resulting ability to produce more lithium will drastically help to find a balance between supply and demand. junior miners in the mix standard lithium ltd. (tsx-v: sll) (fra: s5l) (otcqx: stlhf) launched in 2017 and is led by a management team harboring decades of experience in the lithium mining space. standard lithium stands out in this market because sll is one of the few small cap investment options available in lithium mining that offers a pure play in the u.s. lithium market. this gives standard lithium a key strategic advantage when the u.s. market begins to seek domestic sources of metals like lithium, as per trump's executive order . standard lithium's sole focus is on unlocking the value of existing large-scale u.s.-based lithium bearing brine resources that can be brought into production quickly. the current projects that standard lithium is working on highlight this, such as the bristol dry lake and cadiz dry lake lithium brine projects in california's mojave desert and the recently announced smackover formation lithium brine project in arkansas. in the bristol dry lake area, standard lithium is working quickly to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium, as it outlined in a mid-december update ( http://nnw.fm/1cc5z ). standard lithium installed a total of six new test evaporation ponds at the bristol dry lake property in order to further assess the role that short-duration passive solar evaporation may play in pre-concentrating the near surface lithium brines encountered at the project. standard lithium also took samples of lithium brine from all surface pits in the bristol dry lake property, with results expected in the coming weeks. the cadiz dry lake property will be assessed in a similar manner. the smackover project consists of up to 33,000 acres of brine leases located in a key brine production fairway in southern arkansas, at the disposal of standard lithium for exploration, production, and extraction focus on lithium. based on historical data, these areas have reported values of 370-424 mg/l of lithium in the brines. this elevates the smackover formation as a lower-risk exploration opportunity, which will aid in standard lithium's endeavors to accelerate new production sources of lithium such as this one. new technologies and new approaches standard lithium is looking not just to be a pure play lithium provider, but is also looking to innovate the lithium mining space in ways not yet capitalized upon by other lithium players. according to standard lithium ceo robert mintak, a large portion of the lithium resources currently available ""haven't been viewed through the right lens"" ( http://nnw.fm/0ts9y ). new technologies and new approaches need to be applied in order to accelerate development timeframes in the lithium space. standard lithium is working towards unlocking value on projects that have been overlooked by conventional mining companies. one of the main methods that standard lithium uses is locating areas overlooked but actively producing brine deposits throughout north america, as sll has done in arkansas. the investment community has taken notice. standard lithium's u.s.-listed shares rose from under $0.70 at ipo in june 2017 to a high of $2.23 in late october. standard lithium is also limiting its geological risk and startup expenses, as mintak further details in the interview. ""with the bristol dry lake project in california, we have inked agreements with both of the regions permitted brine operators,"" he noted. ""they have been producing industrial minerals, for decades, - calcium chloride, sodium chloride from the near surface brine at bristol lake, but there's highly anomalous lithium concentrations in that same brine. we know that from historic usgs drilling that was done in the area, and we know that because we have sampled brine, because they're currently producing brine… because of the agreements we have struck we are able to immediately sample raw brine and begin working on the important hydrometallurgy and processing work that any lithium project has to do… having access immediately to raw brine to begin that important work was key for us."" in addition to its sampling efforts, standard lithium has completed drilling work on four of five exploration targets identified at the bristol dry lake property. these results from these targets are expected to play a key role in the development of the project, as they will form the basis of an initial maiden resource assessment under way on the 35,000+ acre land package. as a result, the company intends to be able to produce a single resource statement for the total land package at bristol dry lake. standard aims to have a national instrument 43-101 inferred resource report, which outlines the quantity and quality of minerals estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling, completed during the first half of 2018. standard lithium's fast-track approach to lithium production makes it an intriguing option for investors seeking to gain exposure to the massive upside forecast for the lithium industry. though other small cap investment options are available in lithium mining, few offer a pure play market like standard lithium. another canadian lithium mining firm, nemaska lithium",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"* natgas demand to see higher allocation of growth capital * gas demand to increase 4 times faster than oil * global gas inventory heading to summer below seasonal avg by jessica jaganathan singapore, may 16 (reuters) - demand for natural gas will top other fossil fuels in the long term on the back of rising number of electric vehicles and as new emission standards could see new vessels adopting alternative fuels, according to goldman sachs. this will result in a higher allocation of growth capital in the years ahead, the investment bank said in a note released on wednesday. demand for gas is expected to rise 1.7 percent per year in the period to 2035, four times faster than in case of oil, based on an average from the international energy agency and the energy information administration. “we believe they may diverge in the future as the market digests the robust increase in chinese gas demand over the 2017-2018 winter,” goldman sachs analysts said. beijing is trying to switch more of its energy use to gas from coal to help clear up the foul air in the country’s north through a gasification push. “global lng demand should rebound in the period to august, as cooling demand boosts power generation in temperate regions and bangladesh ramps up imports at the country’s first regasification unit,” the bank said. bangladesh’s lng demand is set to hit 17.5 million tonnes per year by 2025 after the country imported its first cargo last month. global gas inventory levels heading into the summer are below the seasonal average just as stocks of competing fuels, oil and coal, dive to multi-year lows, boosting gas prices, the analysts said. gas inventory across the organisation for economic co-operation and development may be 650 billion cubic feet (bcf) below average, equivalent to a shortfall of 4.3 days of demand. the deficit in march-april was particularly acute in europe where utilities increased imports of liquefied natural gas (lng) and pipeline gas to rebuild inventory, they said. lng supply growth, on the other hand, is on track to reach 8 percent this year, after slowing to 4 percent in april due to disruptions in earthquake-hit papua new guinea and a dip in the utilisation of u.s. and russian terminals, goldman said. as coal plants retire and the share of natural gas in the fuel mix grows, the scope for fuel switching in response to price change may become limited in some markets such as the united kingdom where utilities have less flexibility, which could increase the appeal of gas as an investment, they said. a greater willingness to take on price risk should allow producers with strong balance sheets to drive the next wave of lng investment, they added.

1,"when people think about 3m , the 115-year-old maker of scotch tape, they might not associate the old-line consumer goods manufacturer with electric cars. but that's not how 3m chairman and ceo inge thulin sees it, he said in an exclusive interview on "" mad money "" with cnbc's jim cramer. for thulin and 3m, an old-line manufacturer serving a host of different industries including health care and transportation, auto electrification is just another market. the ceo detailed three elements of 3m that put his massive multinational squarely at the center of the electric car trend: its longtime involvement in the automotive, electronic and energy, and traffic safety industries. ""if you take those three elements together, that is where the future is going,"" thulin told cramer. ""we can capitalize on what we know in traffic safety, which is a very strong position for us not only in vertical signage, but in license plates and also pavement marking. that is where you need to regulate things going forward."" thulin also emphasized the ""incredible competitive position"" the company has in the electronic market and its yearslong leadership in the automotive space. ""as i look upon the future, that's a market that will explode for 3m,"" the ceo said of electric cars. ""that's around $6 billion addressable market with a growth rate of 8 to 10 percent ... and we are now growing that business around 15 to 20 percent if you combine the three elements."" as a company, 3m focuses heavily on research and development. about 30 percent of its sales coming from products that didn't exist five years ago, thulin said. the manufacturer also employs roughly 8,100 scientists to help it develop new products and build its brand equity around the world — one of the four main pillars of 3m. ""the fundamental strings of 3m [are] technology platforms, manufacturing capabilities, geographic reach and brand equity,"" thulin told cramer. to keep those strings intact, thulin said that he's had to make some difficult decisions over the year regarding 3m's many lines of business. ""i found that many businesses inside of 3m did not meet those criteria, and in fact, they were underperforming versus 3m's average,"" the ceo said. ""our expectation is very high. the businesses that could not meet at least three of those four elements, we figure ... they will be better off with a different owner. they were often smaller, the margin was lower, they were not growing as fast and we couldn't create value. so we said, that's not a personal issue, it's a business issue. they can go somewhere else."" at the same time, 3m sought out businesses that stayed true to its four pillars and proved that they could create value, thulin said. ""that's also why we have bought some sizeable businesses. and you're right, they are bigger, they are performing better, they are more profitable and the relevance for us in the market is very, very significant,"" he told cramer.

1,"march 4, 2018 / 4:06 pm / updated 5 hours ago global oil players flock to houston as opec, u.s shale tensions ease ernest scheyder 5 min read houston (reuters) - the oil industry’s biggest names gather this week at ceraweek, the largest energy industry get-together in the americas, at a time when u.s. shale production is booming, global demand is rising and crude prices are at a sweet spot for both big u.s. producers and opec. file photo: an offshore oil platform is seen in huntington beach, california september 28, 2014. reuters/lucy nicholso/file photo last year’s decision by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to restrain output has drained the global glut that occupied much of the conversation at 2017’s gathering. with oil prices lcoc1 up about 15 percent since oil ministers and top executives convened here last year, fears have receded for a slugfest of opec vs. u.s. shale. rising prices have u.s. shale producers pumping more, sending total u.s. output to an all-time record above 10 million barrels per day. this year, the united states could surpass russia as the world’s largest oil producer. opec, meanwhile, has shown no signs of moving to produce more, with output from members at a 10-month low. the cartel’s leaders have even expressed interest in keeping some production curbs in place through 2019. oil ministers and their advisers will use the conference to put shale under a microscope, said dan yergin, vice chairman of conference organizer ihs markit ( info.o ) and a pulitzer prize-winning oil historian. “opec is still really struggling to understand:‘what is this new oil business called shale?’” said yergin.“this conference is a field trip for opec to a different reality in oil.” they have scheduled dinners with shale executives and financiers for the second time in two years, underscoring the maturation of a relationship between big petrostates and a once-upstart industry that weathered opec’s best efforts to bury it under a supply glut from 2014 to 2016. shale has emerged stronger from that period with the permian basin, the largest u.s. oilfield, now producing nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day, triple that of 2009. presentations will look at shale’s rising role in global markets and the potential for future north american production and export growth. “the permian is just now coming into its own,” said randy foutch, chief executive officer of shale producer laredo petroleum inc ( lpi.n ), which plans to boost output 10 percent this year.“we no longer have to find oil and gas. we’ve found it, and will pump it.” opec says it wants to encourage moderation by shale companies as well as its own members. shale firms often use hedges, or financial contracts that lock in a price for future production, to guarantee profits. these contracts protect them should prices slip. “we all should look with responsibility to the market in order to keep the balance in the market as much as we can so as not to harm investors,” said ali nazar, iraq’s national representative to opec. opec views shale as a monolith rather than a collection of independent companies, and hopes executives will say they will keep u.s. output under 10 million barrels per day. but the organization also recognizes shale producers would be violating u.s. antitrust law if they agreed to collective pricing or output pacts, one opec source told reuters. the u.s. energy information administration said on tuesday it expects domestic oil production to surpass 11 million barrels per day late this year. electric cars & big data global oil industry players are also concerned about threats from renewable energy technologies and rapid changes to the automobile industry. majors including bp plc ( bp.l ) have forecast that gasoline use will decline as electric vehicle usage grows. general motors co ( gm.n ) chief executive officer mary barra, in her first visit to the oil conference, is expected to detail plans by the largest u.s. automaker to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023. exxon mobil corp ( xom.n ) and others have said they expect rising petrochemical and aviation fuel demand to offset a drop in demand for liquid fuels such as gasoline. the oil industry is also funding research into big-data, cloud computing and applying new technology to its operations to cut costs and boost production. in a sign of that convergence, the head of alphabet inc’s ( googl.o ) google cloud division also will attend the conference. “the u.s. shale industry has turned out to be amazingly innovative and it’s like open-source software, with everyone experimenting and learning from one another,” said yergin. reporting by ernest scheyder;

1,"february 26, 2018 / 2:04 am / updated 8 minutes ago china's geely raid on daimler reignites german know-how fears michael nienaber , edward taylor , arno schuetze 5 min read berlin/frankfurt (reuters) - automaker geely’s purchase of a $9 billion (6.40 billion pounds) stake in mercedes maker daimler rekindled fears in germany on monday of its highly-prized expertise falling into chinese hands. economy minister brigitte zypries stuck to berlin’s position that geely’s [geely.ul] swoop was a business matter, but said germany’s openness must not be not exploited by other countries. geely, which owns rival swedish carmaker volvo, is pushing daimler for access to know-how in electric and autonomous cars. germany tightened its rules on foreign takeovers last year, the first european union country to do so, after a series of deals saw china gain access to high-tech know-how, while attempts by german companies to buy full control of chinese rivals remains prohibited. although under german law, the government can only intervene if a threshold of 25 percent is exceeded, investors must abide by market rules, zypries said in interviews with daimler’s home-town newspaper stuttgarter zeitung and handelsblatt newspaper. geely revealed its 9.7 percent stake in daimler on friday, surprising the market as it had not disclosed having crossed regulatory thresholds of 3 and 5 percent. financial and markets regulator bafin, which oversees the proper disclosure of stakes said it was investigating whether there had been any breach of disclosure rules, which can result in fines of 10 million euros or more. the chinese carmaker first approached daimler in november and asked it to issue shares so it could buy a stake, as well as for access to battery technology to help set up an electric car joint venture in wuhan, china. daimler, which employs 289,000 people, declined to do a deal as it had reservations about a new industrial alliance for fear of alienating its existing chinese joint venture partner baic, a person familiar with the carmaker’s thinking said. daimler and baic on sunday said they were planning to co-invest more than 11.9 billion yuan ($1.88 billion) to build a new local production base. file photo: li shufu, founder and chairman of zhejiang geely holding group, attends the volvo's s90 news conference in shanghai, china november 2, 2016. reuters/aly song/file photo “daimler has already rejected geely’s overtures once, and daimler execs we spoke with argue it’s simply not clear what geely could offer mercedes,” bernstein research analyst robin zhu said in a note. stealth raid geely responded to the rejection in november by enlisting dirk notheis, the former chief executive of morgan stanley in germany and yi bao, a former ceo of morgan stanley huaxin securities, sources familiar with the matter told reuters. notheis, who declined comment, and yi bao, who could not be reached, devised a way for geely to build a significant stake in daimler using aggressive takeover tactics which german regulators had sought to quash. file photo: the geely automobile holdings logo is pictured at the auto china 2016 auto show in beijing, china april 25, 2016. reuters/kim kyung-hoon/file photo geely worked with bank of america merrill lynch, which declined to comment on monday, to help secure a 9.69 percent voting stake using derivatives to help skirt disclosure requirements, two people familiar with the deal told reuters. mercedes-benz executives in stuttgart were at first caught off guard by the approach, but welcomed geely in meetings on monday to see how to “constructively discuss” industry changes. zhejian geely holding also owns several other carmakers including sweden’s volvo cars, london’s black-cab maker levc and its own geely automobile holdings. it has agreed to buy a $3.3 billion stake in volvo trucks. related coverage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"(adds cook remarks on china) may 1 (reuters) - apple inc on tuesday reported resilient iphone sales in the face of waning global demand and promised $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, reassuring investors that its decade-old smartphone invention had life in it yet. apple's quarterly results topped wall street forecasts, which dropped ahead of the report on growing concern over the iphone. the cupertino, california-based company also was more optimistic about the current quarter than most financial analysts, driving shares up 3.6 percent to $175.25 after hours. suppliers around the globe had warned of smartphone weakness, playing into fears that the company known for popularizing personal computers, tablets and smartphones had become too reliant on the iphone. sales of 52.2 million iphones against a wall street target of 52.3 million was a comfort and up from 50.7 million last year, according to data from thomson reuters i/b/e/s. apple bought $23.5 billion of stock in the march quarter, and said it planned to hike its dividend 16 percent, compared with a 10.5 percent increase last year. analysts believe the heavy emphasis on buybacks will bolster share prices, but some investors wished apple had found different uses for the cash. ""id hoped for more on the dividend side or maybe a strategic investment,"" said hal eddins, chief economist for apple shareholder capital investment counsel. ""i assume apple cant find a strategic investment at the current prices that will move the needle for them. the $100 billion buyback is good for right now but its not exactly looking to the future."" the cash apple earmarked for stock buybacks is about twice the $50 billion market capitalization of electric car maker tesla inc. apple posted revenue for its march quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year. wall street expected $60.8 billion, according to thomson reuters i/b/e/s. average selling prices for iphones were $728, compared with wall street expectations of $742. the figure is up more than 10 percent from $655 a year ago, suggesting that apple's iphone x, which starts at $999, has helped boost prices. analysts had feared the high price was muting demand for the iphone x, but apple chief executive tim cook said it was the most popular iphone model every week in the march quarter. ""this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iphone model has also been the most popular,"" cook said during the company's earnings call. ""it's one of those things like when a team wins the super bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points. but it's a super bowl winner and that's how we feel about it."" the iphone x has shaped up to be ""a good, not a great product. there was a time prior to its introduction that investors expected it to be a great product,"" said thomas forte, an analyst with d.a. davidson companies. ""now that we know it is a good product, as investors have lowered expectations, that is enough, in my view, for shares to go higher from current levels."" apple also predicted revenue of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in the june quarter, ahead of the $51.6 billion wall street expected as of monday evening, and the share repurchases in the march quarter drove apple's cash net of debt down slightly to $145 billion. ""we are returning the cash to investors as we have promised, chief financial officer luca maestri told reuters in an interview. profits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share, as of monday, and up from $2.10 a year ago. apple's services business, which includes apple music, the app store and icloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion. heading into earnings, investors were hopeful that growth in that segment could help offset the cooling global smartphone market. julie ask, an analyst with forrester, said apples services segment results were positive but warned that apple needed to continue to boost subscriptions on its platforms, which reached 270 million users in the march quarter and includes people who subscribe to third-party apps on the iphone as well as apples own services like icloud. apps are carrying most (services revenue) right now, but apple needs to get to a place where its mostly subscriptions and monthly fees and not just one-off downloads, ask said. apple traditionally updates its share buyback and dividend program each spring, and the $100 billion it added this year compares with an increase of $50 billion last year. in february, apple said it planned to draw down its excess cash, although cook had downplayed the possibility of a special dividend. but investors have had concerns around apple because of a brewing trade tensions with china. greater china sales rose 21 percent from a year earlier, apple's best growth rate there in 10 quarters, to $13.0 billion. while there has not yet been a tariff on devices such as apple's iphone, cook traveled last week to washington to meet with u.s. president donald trump at the white house to discuss trade matters. ""china only wins if the u.s. wins and the u.s. only wins if china wins,"" cook said on the call, when asked about a possible trade war. ""i'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently,"" he said. apple has been emphasizing its contributions to the u.s. economy in recent months, outlining a $30 billion u.s. spending plan and highlighting the tens of billions of dollars it spends each year with u.s.-based suppliers. in recent months, apple has been emphasizing the size of its overall user base, which includes used iphones, rather than focusing strictly on new device sales, a sign of the increasing importance of making money off users without selling them new hardware.

1,"(adds comments by trump, fiat chrysler, vw) washington, may 11 (reuters) - ten american and foreign automakers went to the white house on friday to push for a weakening of u.s. fuel efficiency standards through 2025, while president donald trump used the occasion to launch a fresh attack on the north american free trade agreement that has benefited the companies. a draft proposal circulated by the u.s. transportation department would freeze fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, rather than allowing them to increase as previously planned. trump's administration is expected to formally unveil the proposal later this month or in june. ""we're working on cafe standards, environmental controls,"" trump told reporters at the top of the meeting, referring to the corporate average fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks in the united states. trump said he wants automakers to build more vehicles in the united states and export more vehicles. but much of the hour-long meeting focused on nafta. trump blasted the pact involving the united states, canada and mexico as ""terrible"" and noted that negotiations to make changes sought by his administration were ongoing. ""nafta has been a horrible, horrible disaster for this country and we'll see if we can make it reasonable,"" trump said. automakers have called nafta a success, allowing them to integrate production throughout north america and make production competitive with asia and europe, and have noted the increase in auto production over the past two decades with the deal in place. they have warned that changing nafta too much could prompt some companies to move production out of the united states. the chief executives of general motors co, ford motor co, fiat chrysler, along with senior u.s. executives from toyota motor corp, volkswagen ag, hyundai motor co, nissan motor co, honda motor co , bmw ag and daimler ag met with trump, as did the chief executives of two auto trade groups. major automakers reiterated this week they do not support freezing fuel efficiency requirements but said they want new flexibility and rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and the shift in u.s. consumer preferences to bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. fiat chrysler chief executive sergio marchionne told reuters before the meeting his company is ""fully supportive"" of trump's efforts to revise the rules and hoped for ""an agreed way forward."" automakers also want the white house and california to reach agreement on maintaining national standards, fearing a prolonged legal battle could leave the companies facing two different sets of rules - and the state level and nationally - and extended uncertainty. hinrich woebcken, chief executive of the north american region for vw, told reuters the meeting was a ""great opportunity"" to have an exchange of ideas about the future of emissions rules. california and 16 other states covering about 40 percent of the u.s. population filed suit last week to block the trump administration's efforts to weaken the fuel efficiency requirements. marchionne said he still hopes the administration could reach a deal with california to maintain nationwide emissions standards. 'marketplace realities' u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer, transportation secretary elaine chao, white house economic adviser larry kudlow, environmental protection agency chief scott pruitt and white house aide chris liddell are among the administration officials who attended the meeting. mitch bainwol, who heads the alliance of automobile manufacturers, told a congressional committee on tuesday the industry supports ""standards that increase year over year that also are consistent with marketplace realities."" bainwol said the industry remains hopeful that there will be a ""negotiation"" between the white house, california and the auto industry. the industry also notes it faces rising fuel efficiency standards around the globe and is spending billions of dollars to introduce new battery electric vehicles in the coming years. democrats and environmental advocates plan to aggressively challenge the trump administration's plans to weaken the vehicle rules touted by democratic former president barack obama's administration as one of its biggest actions to combat climate change by reducing planet-warming emissions. the trump administration plans to argue the weaker rules will lead to cheaper vehicles, boost sales and employment and improve safety by prodding faster turnover of older vehicles. the obama-era rules adopted in 2012 sought to double average fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025, but included an evaluation due by april 2018 to determine if the rules were appropriate.

0,"may 9, 2018 / 12:51 pm / in 8 minutes french car parts group faurecia invests in u.s. firm powersphyr reuters staff 2 min read paris, may 9 (reuters) - french car parts company faurecia has made an investment, for an undisclosed sum of money, in u.s. wireless power technology company powersphyr, in the latest example of car companies striking deals with start-up tech firms. the powersphyr deal, announed by the companies on wednesday, follows a similar move by faurecia, which is 46-percent owned by peugeot-maker psa, earlier this year to invest in start-up energy technology company enogia. as carmakers ramp up spending on self-driving and electric vehicles (evs), many investors have been betting that their component suppliers will be the first winners from the technology shifts. that partly reflects a longer-term change towards more complex vehicles where components makers are contributing an ever-larger proportion of a car’s total value. it is also an acknowledgement that the big innovations are happening as much in the auto industry’s scattered supply base as in the design hubs of the big carmakers, also known as original equipment manufacturers (oems).

0,"beijing (reuters) - volkswagen ag, the world’s biggest automaker, is in talks to form a joint venture with china’s didi chuxing to manage part of the ride-hailing company’s fleet of cars and help develop “purpose-built” vehicles for didi’s services. file photo: the logo of didi chuxing is seen at its headquarters in beijing, china, may 18, 2016. reuters/kim kyung-hoon/file photo as part of the deal between volkswagen and china’s biggest ride-hailing service, expected to be signed early next month, the german automaker will initially manage a fleet of about 100,000 new vehicles for didi, of which two-thirds will be volkswagen group cars, said a senior executive at the carmaker. volkswagen will also jointly buy some new cars with didi to allow the chinese company to expand its fleet. the two eventually plan to collaborate to design and develop dedicated vehicles, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the details are still private. the executive did not give financial details of the deal but said that volkswagen will get a slice of the revenue once the venture develops. the growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as beijing and shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership. this could have serious consequences for existing carmakers and is forcing companies like volkswagen to reinvent their businesses and seek out future revenue streams. “to succeed as a car company in this new ecosystem, we need to know who our customer is, what their journey is and what our strategy should be,” the executive said. he added that this deal will eventually give volkswagen access to some of didi’s massive trove of data on customer behaviour collected through the 3 million rides didi provides in china each day. the ultimate goal is the production and use of autonomous cars, the volkswagen executive said. riding alone volkswagen’s partnership with didi is the first known project didi has begun pursuing as part of a broad alliance the chinese company recently formed with 31 automakers and parts suppliers. didi has said it formed the alliance to collaborate on, among other things, eventually developing cars purpose-built for its services. for instance, as many as 80 percent of didi customers ride alone and don’t need a big four-seater car, the volkswagen executive said. and current vehicles have engines and other technology that allow them to go as fast as 150 mph (250 kmph). dedicated ride-sharing vehicles would always travel much slower, so they would not need to be aerodynamic or have a powerful engine. that could allow for fewer seats and more room for luggage. didi has also predicted much of its future fleet would be electric. the company has begun working with chinese carmakers gac motor and chj automotive to design electric vehicles, sources have told reuters. three didi officials said the ultimate shape of a new ride-sharing market is still unclear and no one knows what role car manufacturers and didi itself will play in it. open questions for didi are how to repair, maintain and direct a fleet of autonomous vehicles, one of the officials said. “our understanding right now is that probably automakers don’t know 100 percent how to do all that. didi also doesn’t know either,” the official said. a spokesperson for didi said both sides were still working out the details of how the partnership would look. “potentially, both parties will focus on building together a fleet operation business, and look into other potential areas such as designing new car models for ride-hailing,” the spokesperson said. the didi officials did not want to be named because they are not authorised to talk to reporters. after years of resistance and efforts to keep technology-based ride companies at arm’s length and vowing never to be like contract manufacturers are to the mobile phone sellers, carmakers are becoming more flexible. the car industry fears becoming like taipei-headquartered electronics company foxconn, which manufactures millions of phones for the likes of apple inc but only gets a slim share of the profits in return. this year, automakers like fiat, jaguar land rover and honda motor entered into an agreement to provide thousands of cars to alphabet inc’s self-driving unit, waymo. last year volvo and daimler ag said they would supply cars to uber. vw’s war chest volkswagen lags its rivals daimler and bmw in embracing the transformation but has recently stepped up its efforts. it has created a war chest of 15 billion euros ($18.2 billion), which it plans to use for investments in ride-hailing, autonomous driving, digitalisation, electric mobility and other services in china by 2022. it has already invested in an artificial intelligence firm called mobvoi, a car-sharing company shouqi and a second-hand car buying company. volkswagen is also in talks to invest in a luxury ride-hailing company and an electric car charging business, the executive said. once volkswagen has access to customer data, it will be able to make better-informed decisions on future businesses and products. “we will explore additional business models with didi,” the executive said, adding that these may not necessarily be focused only on china. volkswagen is internally discussing bus and truck sharing. “we don’t need to have all the answers. the money we plan to put into the first phase should help us find some,” he said. the executive did not say whether the new cars provided by volkswagen would be electric, hybrid or gasoline.

1,"january 30, 2018 / 7:44 am / updated 2 hours ago volkswagen suspends company lobbyist over 'repulsive' diesel fume tests andreas cremer , edward taylor 5 min read  berlin/frankfurt (reuters) - volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) suspended its chief lobbyist on tuesday in response to reports the carmaker had sponsored tests that exposed monkeys and humans to toxic diesel fumes, methods condemned by its chief executive as repulsive.  europe’s largest automaker has come under fresh scrutiny after the new york times said last week that it and german peers bmw and daimler funded an organisation called european research group on environment and health in the transport sector (eugt) to commission the tests.  the report came more than two years after volkswagen (vw) admitted to cheating u.s. diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history, and pledged sweeping changes to ensure such misconduct never happened again.  “over the weekend we had to learn once more that there is still a long way ahead of us to regain lost trust,” vw ceo matthias mueller said late on monday at a reception in brussels in his first public remarks on the tests.  “the methods used by eugt in the united states were wrong, they were unethical and repulsive,” he said. “i am sorry that volkswagen was involved in the matter as one of the sponsors of eugt.”  on tuesday, vw management board accepted an offer by thomas steg, its chief lobbyist since 2012 and a former german government spokesman, to step aside. it appointed politics expert jens hanefeld as his interim replacement.  a spokesman for vw chairman hans dieter poetsch said the supervisory board’s executive committee will meet next week to discuss the internal investigations and ensure that such incidents will not be repeated.  “the boundaries of decent and moral conduct were clearly crossed,” said bernd osterloh, vw’s labour boss, adding he will leave no doubt about workers’ opposition to such tests at next week’s meeting. “it appears as if some at vw have lost their ethical and moral bearings.” diesel in the dock  the study, conducted in 2014, was designed to defend diesel following revelations that the fuel’s exhaust fumes were carcinogenic, the new york times reported.  reuters could not confirm the details and purpose of the study and eugt, which was dissolved last year, could not be reached for comment.  bmw and daimler have also denounced the tests.  mueller, a company veteran who became ceo after the emissions test cheating scandal broke in september 2015, has complained on several occasions that tackling vw’s closed-off corporate culture was proving tougher than expected. a car with the volkswagen vw logo badge is seen on display at the north american international auto show in detroit, michigan, u.s., january 16, 2018. reuters/jonathan ernst  he said the new york times report showed vw had to raise its game in improving ethical standards, and pledged to take the necessary action once it had finished investigating eugt’s work.  “we must live and deal with setbacks,” he said.  vw said on monday the eugt study was never discussed in any management board meetings, after the bild newspaper reported an internal e-mail showed at least some senior managers were informed about the design of the research.  the study risks dealing another blow to diesel technology, in which the german auto industry has invested heavily.  mueller and ceos from german manufacturers and suppliers including daimler and continental will on tuesday discuss ways of trying to regain the initiative after the fume test revelations, two auto industry sources told reuters.  executives are expected to meet in berlin on tuesday to elect the new head of germany’s vda car industry lobby. coming clean  to regain trust, carmakers should increase support for efforts by local authorities to tackle diesel pollution, for instance by promoting electric car use in cities, said stefan bratzel, head of the center of automotive management think-tank near cologne.  “this scandalous affair will raise even more pressure on carmakers to help with the transition and come clean on their past sins once and for all,” bratzel said.  earlier on tuesday, the vda said carmakers were in talks with cities including berlin and hamburg about ways to speed up and expand steps to tackle pollution from diesel vehicles in a bid to avoid possible bans, without giving details.  german environment minister barbara hendricks, meeting in brussels on tuesday to discuss government measures designed to improve air quality in badly polluted cities, called the tests irresponsible.  german autos supplier robert bosch said on tuesday the revelations were damaging for the entire industry and that a decline in demand for diesel could pose a threat to jobs.  “bosch had nothing to do with the animal experiments. i am as appalled as you all are,” ceo volkmar denner said. related

1,"tesla said on friday that a tesla model x involved a fatal crash in california last week had activated its autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. tesla also said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by the driver soon before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel. ""the driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken,"" tesla said. the statement did not say why the autopilot system apparently did not detect the concrete divider. the fatal crash and vehicle fire of the tesla near mountain view, california, involved two other cars and delayed traffic for hours. the 38-year-old tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash. the national highway traffic safety administration, which launched crash earlier this week, did not immediately comment late friday. the national transportation safety board is also investigating the fatal crash. autopilot allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel ""at all times"" before they can use autopilot, but users routinely tout the fact they can use the system to drive hands-free. the ntsb faulted tesla in a prior fatal autopilot crash. in september, ntsb chairman robert sumwalt said operational limitations in the tesla model s played a major role in a may 2016 crash that killed a driver using autopilot. that death — the first fatality in a tesla vehicle operating in autopilot mode — raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. the ntsb said tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention and for ""overreliance on vehicle automation."" in january, nhtsa and ntsb launched investigations into a tesla vehicle, apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode, that struck a fire truck in california. neither agency nor tesla has offered any update. the government probes raise the risk for tesla and automakers at a time when the industry is seeking federal legislation that would ease deployment of self driving cars. the crash comes soon after an uber vehicle in arizona in self-driving mode struck and killed a pedestrian in the first death linked to an autonomous vehicle. tesla said late friday that ""autopilot does not prevent all accidents — such a standard would be impossible — but it makes them much less likely to occur. it unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists."" tesla said that ""there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. for tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with autopilot hardware."" tesla in september 2016 unveiled improvements to autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving. on thursday, tesla said it was recalling 123,000 model s sedans built before april 2016 in order to replace bolts in the power steering component that can begin to corrode after contact in cold temperatures with road salt. no accidents or injuries were reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"(reuters) - canada’s nemaska lithium ( nmx.to ) said on tuesday it had secured funding of up to c$402 million ($314 million) from investors, which it plans to use to build a mine and processing plant to produce lithium, the key ingredient for rechargeable batteries. this brings to more than c$1.1 billion the amount of money nemaska has raised this year for its proposed operations, as the quebec-based company rides a wave of interest in lithium for batteries used in electric vehicles and mobile phones. “today marks a big day in the life of nemaska lithium, as we are announcing the last piece of financing required to start the commercial development of the whabouchi lithium mine project,” nemaska chief executive guy bourassa said in a statement. nemaska is developing the whabouchi hard rock lithium project in quebec, one of north america’s largest spodumene deposits. under the deal announced on tuesday, nemaska said national bank financial, bmo capital markets and cantor fitzgerald canada had agreed to purchase 280 million of its shares at c$1 each in a bought deal. they have the option to increase this by c$42 million. in addition, nemaska has agreed to do a private placement of 80 million shares at c$1 each with an unnamed institutional investor. nemaska’s shares closed at c$1.18 on the toronto stock exchange on tuesday, down 9 canadian cents. in april, nemaska said japan’s softbank group corp ( 9984.t ) would invest in its shares. it has also done a stream financing and a bond offering. reporting by nicole mordant in vancouver, editing by rosalba o'brien",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"Looking at the video, it looks like the Street Guardian was looking through a coated lens or fogged windshield. It may cause the circular bloom around bright objects. Perhaps you might try a direct shot outside the car to determine if it is a windshield vs lens effect.In contrast, the Tesla appears to have a clear view possibly through an angled glass. The narrow, vertical blooms suggest an angled glass in front of the lens.I prefer video acuity over a wide view. For a wider view, my preference is a double camera dash cam, both angled with an overlapped view. Still, I can appreciate others having a different preference.The occasional dropouts in the Tesla cam reminds me of pauses found when switching recording files in my earlier dash cams.

1,"shanghai (reuters) - li shufu, chairman of chinese carmaker geely, is making waves in the global auto market after buying a $9 billion stake in germany’s daimler ag ( daign.de ). li, 54, the son of a farmer from china’s eastern zhejiang province, has led a major acquisition push globally since 2010, when he took over swedish car brand volvo from ford motor co ( f.n ) in a $1.8 billion deal. over the last year, he has snapped up a $3.3 billion stake in truck maker ab volvo ( volvb.st ), a majority stake in sports car maker lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in malaysian automaker proton and flying car start-up terrafugia. he already owns levc, the maker of london’s iconic black cabs. li, sometimes compared to u.s. auto icon henry ford, founded zhejiang geely holding group in 1986, which was at the time focused on refrigerators. he moved into motorbike manufacturing in the 1990s before switching to autos in 1997. the daimler deal is the biggest overseas purchase yet for the business leader, who is ranked 10th on the forbes china rich list with a fortune of $16.5 billion. it is also a major gamble amid what li calls a “a battle” against foreign companies shaking up the global automotive market, namely tech firms like tesla ( tsla.o ), google ( googl.o ), uber [uber.ul] and china’s own baidu ( bidu.o ) pushing into autonomous driving, electric vehicles and car sharing. “no current car industry player will be able to win this battle against the invaders from outside independently,” he said in a statement announcing his daimler stake, which makes him the largest shareholder in the owner of mercedes-benz. the listed autos unit of his empire, geely automobile holdings ltd ( 0175.hk ), saw its shares rise 6.5 percent on monday after the investment was announced. the stake gives li a potential boost in his bid to convince the german company to share technology with geely - an area li sees as key to survival - even if analysts said this would still be no easy task. “a new stage of global scientific revolution and industrial transformation is already upon us,” he wrote in a speech in december posted on his personal website. “artificial intelligence, new energy sources and inter-connectivity are right in front of us.” the investment could also affect daimler’s existing joint venture in china with baic motor corp ( 1958.hk ). on monday ab volvo said it would drop a board member because li’s stake in daimler created competition concerns. li also now plays an active political role in china and is a regular delegate to the chinese people’s political consultative conference, a largely ceremonial political advisory body. but his political nous may have helped get the huge investment done smoothly, analysts and local media said, especially amid a fierce crackdown on overseas deals. an advance last year by geely for a stake in daimler was rebuffed. the official xinhua news agency said on monday that geely reflected a wider “bullish” push by local automakers overseas and the overall “rising strength of chinese automakers”. li’s business ambitions appear to align with those of china’s government, which wants to strengthen the country’s high-tech expertise and leapfrog global auto rivals by becoming a leader in electric vehicles and autonomous driving. “it strikes me as an investment that fits into an overall china strategy of getting technologies that will further (china‘s) automotive strategic ambitions,” said james chao, asia-pacific chief of consultancy ihs markit automotive. reporting by adam jourdan; editing by gerry doyle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"14 am / updated 9 minutes ago with easy ride trial, nissan takes new step toward being uber competitor naomi tajitsu 5 min read yokohama (reuters) - facing a future in which self-driving cars may curb vehicle ownership, nissan motor co is taking its first steps to becoming an operator of autonomous transportation services, hoping to break into a segment set to be dominated by uber technologies and other technology firms. in partnership with japanese mobile gaming platform operator dena co, the automaker will begin public field tests of its easy ride service in yokohama next month, becoming among the first major automakers anywhere to test ride-hailing software developed in-house, using its own fleet of self-driving electric cars. easy ride, which nissan plans to launch in japan in the early 2020s, is meant to feel more like a concierge service on wheels, making - for example - restaurant recommendations while the car is on the move. the announcement follows an agreement by nissan and its automaking partners renault sa and mitsubishi motors corp earlier this month to explore future cooperation with chinese transportation services conglomerate didi chuxing. these moves mark a push by the automaker to avoid becoming the “foxconn of the auto industry”: a mere vehicle supplier to ride- and car-sharing companies. “we realize that it’s going to take time to become a service operator, but we want to enter into this segment by partnering with companies which are experts in the field,” nissan’s chief executive, hiroto saikawa, told reuters in an interview this month. a person close to the deal has said that the agreement is intended to explore opportunities for nissan and others to supply battery-electric cars to didi chuxing for a new electric car-sharing service it is setting up in china. he noted however that nissan and its alliance partners could explore a broader agreement, which might possibly involve nissan providing self-driving taxi technology to the dominant chinese ride-hailing service. niche market a self-driving vehicle, based on nissan leaf electric vehicle (ev), for easy ride service, developed by nissan and mobile gaming platform operator dena co, is seen during its media preview in yokohama, japan, february 21, 2018. picture taken february 21, 2018. reuters/toru hanai creating an upscale autonomous taxi service, rather than trying to beat other companies on price, could help nissan against bigger competitors like uber, market experts say. “by doing something with a more premium feel, it could allow nissan to charge more for its service and potentially relieve some of that profitability pressure they could face if they were to try to race to the bottom in terms of pricing,” said jeremy carlson, automotive analyst at ihs markit. automakers are looking for ways to profit from the rise of car-sharing services, which along with self-driving cars, are likely to lead to a decrease vehicle ownership and chip away at future profits. slideshow (4 images) ihs markit expects global sales of autonomous vehicles will soar to more than 33 million units in 2040 from 51,000 in 2021, while goldman sachs has predicted that the ride-hailing market will grow eightfold by 2030 to be five times the current size of the taxi market. nissan has embraced new technologies, launching the leaf, the world’s first mass-market electric car, in 2010. the company was an early proponent of self-driving cars, pledging in 2013 that it would market fully autonomous cars in 2020. although it has been rolling out automated highway driving functions and self-parking capabilities in a growing number of its models, rivals ranging from tesla inc to subaru corp have installed increasingly advanced self-driving features in their cars. gm and daimler ag are building and expanding car- sharing services, and gm has said it plans to launch a self-driving taxi service next year. nissan also has its own car-sharing service using its ultra-compact battery electric models, but after years of trials, the service is available only in yokohama, home to the automaker’s headquarters. after bringing in ogi redzic, who previously led the automotive business group of mapping data firm here technologies, to head renault-nissan’s mobility services division in early 2016, nissan in the past year or so has begun to gear up its strategy to compete in the new transportation area. its partner dena is one of the world’s biggest social gaming networks with 30 million users. the company’s expertise in developing real-time user interfaces and payment systems will help give shape to the taxi service platform. the company already operates a user-sourced car-sharing app in japan, and had been developing a self-driving taxi system with a japanese robotics start-up before teaming up with nissan. additional reporting by norihiko shirouzu in beijingediting by gerry doyle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"april 30, 2018 / 11:10 am / updated 14 minutes ago exclusive - volkswagen in talks to manage didi fleet, co-develop self-driving cars aditi shah , norihiko shirouzu 6 min read beijing (reuters) - volkswagen ag ( vowg_p.de ), the world’s biggest automaker, is in talks to form a joint venture with china’s didi chuxing to manage part of the ride-hailing company’s fleet of cars and help develop “purpose-built” vehicles for didi’s services. file photo: a car with the volkswagen vw logo badge is seen on display at the north american international auto show in detroit, michigan, u.s., january 16, 2018. reuters/jonathan ernst as part of the deal between volkswagen and china’s biggest ride-hailing service, expected to be signed early next month, the german automaker will initially manage a fleet of about 100,000 new vehicles for didi, of which two-thirds will be volkswagen group cars, said a senior executive at the carmaker. volkswagen will also jointly buy some new cars with didi to allow the chinese company to expand its fleet. the two eventually plan to collaborate to design and develop dedicated vehicles, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the details are still private. the executive did not give financial details of the deal but said that volkswagen will get a slice of the revenue once the venture develops. the growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as beijing and shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership. this could have serious consequences for existing carmakers and is forcing companies like volkswagen to reinvent their businesses and seek out future revenue streams. “to succeed as a car company in this new ecosystem, we need to know who our customer is, what their journey is and what our strategy should be,” the executive said. he added that this deal will eventually give volkswagen access to some of didi’s massive trove of data on customer behaviour collected through the 3 million rides didi provides in china each day. the ultimate goal is the production and use of autonomous cars, the volkswagen executive said. riding alone volkswagen’s partnership with didi is the first known project didi has begun pursuing as part of a broad alliance the chinese company recently formed with 31 automakers and parts suppliers. file photo: the logo of didi chuxing is seen at its headquarters in beijing, china, may 18, 2016. reuters/kim kyung-hoon/file photo didi has said it formed the alliance to collaborate on, among other things, eventually developing cars purpose-built for its services. for instance, as many as 80 percent of didi customers ride alone and don’t need a big four-seater car, the volkswagen executive said. and current vehicles have engines and other technology that allow them to go as fast as 150 mph (250 kmph). dedicated ride-sharing vehicles would always travel much slower, so they would not need to be aerodynamic or have a powerful engine. that could allow for fewer seats and more room for luggage. didi has also predicted much of its future fleet would be electric. the company has begun working with chinese carmakers gac motor and chj automotive to design electric vehicles, sources have told reuters. three didi officials said the ultimate shape of a new ride-sharing market is still unclear and no one knows what role car manufacturers and didi itself will play in it. open questions for didi are how to repair, maintain and direct a fleet of autonomous vehicles, one of the officials said. “our understanding right now is that probably automakers don’t know 100 percent how to do all that. didi also doesn’t know either,” the official said. a spokesperson for didi said both sides were still working out the details of how the partnership would look. “potentially, both parties will focus on building together a fleet operation business, and look into other potential areas such as designing new car models for ride-hailing,” the spokesperson said. the didi officials did not want to be named because they are not authorised to talk to reporters. after years of resistance and efforts to keep technology-based ride companies at arm’s length and vowing never to be like contract manufacturers are to the mobile phone sellers, carmakers are becoming more flexible. the car industry fears becoming like taipei-headquartered electronics company foxconn ( 2354.tw ), which manufactures millions of phones for the likes of apple inc ( aapl.o ) but only gets a slim share of the profits in return. this year, automakers like fiat ( fcha.mi ), jaguar land rover and honda motor ( 7267.t ) entered into an agreement to provide thousands of cars to alphabet inc’s ( googl.o ) self-driving unit, waymo. last year volvo ( volvb.st ) and daimler ag ( daign.de ) said they would supply cars to uber. vw’s war chest volkswagen lags its rivals daimler and bmw ( bmwg.de ) in embracing the transformation but has recently stepped up its efforts. it has created a war chest of 15 billion euros (13.2 billion pounds), which it plans to use for investments in ride-hailing, autonomous driving, digitalisation, electric mobility and other services in china by 2022. it has already invested in an artificial intelligence firm called mobvoi, a car-sharing company shouqi and a second-hand car buying company. volkswagen is also in talks to invest in a luxury ride-hailing company and an electric car charging business, the executive said. once volkswagen has access to customer data, it will be able to make better-informed decisions on future businesses and products. “we will explore additional business models with didi,” the executive said, adding that these may not necessarily be focused only on china. volkswagen is internally discussing bus and truck sharing. “we don’t need to have all the answers. the money we plan to put into the first phase should help us find some,” he said. the executive did not say whether the new cars provided by volkswagen would be electric, hybrid or gasoline. reporting by aditi shah and norihiko shirouzu in beijing; editing by

1,"nder how that would affect the motor in the long term.Additionally, I can't understand how this system could work while stationary.As for efficacy of this method, I dunno, lots of people complaining of the reduction of regen and slow charge in cold weather, which leads me to think whatever heating this method generates is not sufficient to allow full regen nor fast charge....Click to expand...Like P-P says, and AFAIK, the issues of slow charge and reduction of regen in the cold are issues with all BEVS. Batteries simply can't handle as much current when cold (and especially below 0C), so they have to be heated, and charging either by regen or when stationary is slower in the winter. And there were many more SR+ out there than Konas last winter so these issues would be more thoroughly discussed with the SR+Also I think I read in Electrek or somewhere that the motor heating method can generate as much as 4000W of heat but varies according to temperature. Apparently this is similar to the resistive heaters in similar sized battery packs, so it should be able to handle the battery heating chores of an SR+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"may 23, 2018 / 5:53 pm / updated 6 minutes ago tesla shares seen rising despite 'fever pitch' of bad news: analyst noel randewich 3 min read san francisco (reuters) - negative news stories about tesla inc have hit “fever pitch”, but the electric carmaker’s stock price is likely to surge as output of its model 3 sedan improves, according to an analyst research report. file photo: a tesla dealership is seen in west drayton, just outside london, britain, february 7, 2018. reuters/hannah mckay/file photo following the publication of baird equity research analyst ben kallo’s note on wednesday, tesla chief executive chimed in with a series of tweets critical of journalists’ coverage of his company. musk said on twitter that he would create a website where readers could score the truth of news stories. “problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. tricky situation, as tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers,” musk tweeted. tesla’s stock rose 1.48 percent to end at $279.07. kallo said news reports about factory accidents, employee turnover, and production pauses have contributed to investor pessimism but sentiment would likely recover as the company fixes factory bottlenecks and increases output of its model 3. “sentiment is as negative as we have experienced around tesla, and we want to lean into the fever pitch,” wrote kallo, one of nine analysts who recommend buying tesla’s stock, according to thomson reuters data. he called the rise of negative tesla headlines over the past month “increasingly immaterial.” another eight analysts recommend selling tesla, and nine have neutral ratings. shares of tesla remain down 7.0 percent since the silicon valley company reported quarterly financial results on may 2, when musk refused to answer questions from analysts about the electric vehicle maker’s capital requirements, saying “boring, bonehead questions are not cool.” musk has repeatedly missed targets for model 3 production, which tesla is banking on to establish itself as a mass market seller of electric cars. tesla’s stock has lost over a quarter of its value since closing at a record high last september. a series of fiery tesla car crashes and executive departures have also worried investors. after consumer reports said on monday that the model 3 had “big flaws”, including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck, musk responded on twitter that tesla would fix the car’s braking system with a software update. the mean analyst price target for tesla has dipped to $289 from $326 a month ago. kallo’s target of $411 is about 50 percent higher than wednesday’s price. on tesla’s recent quarterly results conference call, kallo commented that the flow of negative news stories about tesla was making it difficult for even “believers” to own the company’s stock. musk responded that investors worried about volatility should steer clear of tesla’s shares. graphic - tesla timeline: reut.rs/2gmqm3k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"oil prices jumped after president trump scuttled the iranian nuclear deal, pushing gas prices higher. will pump prices pummel your driving budget this summer — and thereafter? my research says no. oil's budget-bashing potential went the way of the eight-track. recent price wiggles won't last. why? americans routinely fear higher oil. memories of disco-era oil shocks, gas lines and stagflation loom large, passed on as lore from my generation to our kids. back then, the middle east dominated oil, given opec's embargo pricing power. more from usa today: starbucks letter to employees: no purchases needed to sit inside, use bathroom women's sneaker sales are growing as sales of high heels tumble, new report claims souped-up tesla model 3 electric car will cost $78,000, ceo elon musk teases but those days are dead. iran isn't really crucial now. it produces about 4.5 million barrels of oil a day, exporting just 2.5 million barrels. u.s. crude production is now 10.5 million barrels a day and should reach 11.9 million barrels next year. saudi arabia has promised to help some, too. we and they more than offset the 1 million barrels-a-day reduction in iranian exports officials expect from the return of sanctions. but realistically, iran will export as much as before. as detailed in my april 15 column , single-country sanctions never bite. companies work around them, diverting shipments through third parties for a minor brokerage commission mark-up. the only real change is altered shipping routes. iran sells most of its oil to china, which is unaffected by these sanctions. to see how trivial iran is for oil, note 2012 to 2016, when western sanctions blocked iranian oil exports to america and europe. oil prices plunged from more than $100 a barrel to $26 in january 2016. perversely, in 2016, when iran restarted exporting to europe, prices rose. but other forces were dominating the market by then. which ones? the u.s. technology revolution in oil shale, hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking), horizontal drilling and more. when those iranian sanctions took full effect in july 2012, america produced just 6.3 million barrels a day of crude. by 2016 we were at 9.2 million barrels a day — a bigger increase than iran's total exports. that surge helps explain global production's jump from 76 million barrels a day to 81.5 million in the same period, creating a global glut. in february 2016, with oil prices low, producers started cutting back because their profits were smaller. they mothballed rigs and slashed investment in new wells. meanwhile, opec and russia mostly stuck to their much-ballyhooed output cuts. slower-growing supply and healthy global demand helped oil prices bounce back up. but that shift has gone too far, and the new trends driving the oil market are eye-popping. u.s. production rose in 2017. this year, new exploration rigs are operating 100%. extraction technology keeps improving, cutting costs. some oil fields are now profitable below $40 a barrel. pumping at today's $70 price produces premium profits. capacity will gush. as this technology evolves, it starts rippling overseas, goosing output and capping crude prices. still, don't expect gasoline prices to get too low. they're less variable than oil. depending on the state, taxes are between 10.7% (alabama) and 25.5% (pennsylvania) of the per gallon price of regular gas. the average is about 16%, or 53.7 cents a gallon. those taxes remain stable despite oil's gyrations. another factor is supply bottlenecks — especially in west texas, where pipelines to gulf coast refiners are backing up. it will be tough to provide dirt-cheap gas everywhere without expanding capacity. another irony: these regional bottlenecks create incentives for producers to drill more in north dakota and oklahoma, where similar bottlenecks in 2012 inspired pipeline bonanzas. even more oil production will come there. even so, gas prices should be ok for your 2018 vacation budget. the u.s. has the world's greatest natural geography and low-cost vacation destinations. so enjoy them while goldilocks reigns over our economy ( see my may 6 column on that topic ) and tune out the geopolitical noise. if you've never driven to yellowstone, you really do owe it to yourself and your family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"bjro9, the Model 3. I don't commute because I have a home office so most of my driving is for road trips that we do every weekend. CCS cars are useless for road trips at the moment, most of the CCS chargers are 50KW and they have only one charger per location so if it's out of order or ICEd you'd be screwed. The Tesla SC network has excellent coverage in New England, there is a convenient SC at all the places that we go in Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island so the Model 3 is a viable vehicle. I'm sure that at some point the CCS network will equal and then surpass the Supercharger network but there is no way of knowing when that will happen, my guess is that it will take five years. What's worse for the CCS network is that there is no easy way of knowing when or where they will be putting chargers, Tesla shows there planned locations on their map so for places that currently aren't accessible, the Canadian Maritimes for example, you have a good idea of when they will get coverage.Click to expand...Interesting to read your CCS rant, just the opposite situation here on the west coast, leaving Seattle on any of the main roads out (South, North, or East) CCS chargers are much more dense than Tesla Superchargers. Right now Electrify America has as many active locations in WA state then does Tesla, and they also have 12 additional locations that have completed construction and are just awaiting commissioning. This is only Electrify America's Cycle 1 of 4, and already passed the Supercharger Network in this area, and now that Cycle 2 is getting started there are a dozen or so more stations slated for WA state bringing the total locations of EA chargers in WA to 40 compared to Tesla's 15 (with Tesla having ZERO under construction). Most of the EA stations have 150kW charging capability, and all of the Highway stations also have 350 kW for those that buy the Taycan. EA has also built some 50 kW stations in local areas that make sense, (Lynnwood, Redmond, Renton, Monroe) as for those of us with E-Tron know, on a 150 kW charger there is no way you can go eat lunch while the car is charging, as it only takes <30 minutes 10-90% SOC, not near enough time to order and eat. Shoot, I tried to just go get Subway on one stop, and the car was well past 80% before I could get back to it, sandwich in hand. Is there such a thing as charging too fast?BTW, Tesla has been showing planned locations on their map for years, you better rub a lamp if you think those are real stations that are coming soon as Tesla has cut Capital Expenditures for 2019 in half compared to previous guidance (most of which is going to GF3, and new lines in Fremont). Tesla currently only has a handful of stations under construction in the USA and EA has over 200 currently under construction, not even comparable. Tesla had 7 years head start, and EA nearly caught them in most of the USA in just over 1 year, and EA is still accelerating their rollout.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"singapore/berlin (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s decision to slap tariffs on solar panel imports is a blow to a booming global industry, and hit stocks in european and asian solar groups on fears their business might suffer. although the move was intended to help american manufacturers, some in the sector said it would slow u.s. investment in solar power and cost thousands of u.s. jobs. trump on monday approved a 30 percent tariff on solar cell and module imports, dropping to 15 percent within four years. up to 2.5 gigawatts (gw) of unassembled solar cells can be imported tariff-free in each year. the news sent sma solar, germany’s largest solar group, which makes 46 percent of its sales in the americas, down 4.6 percent to a four-week low, while norway’s rec silicon shed 1.2 percent. german finance minister peter altmaier said the cost of solar products in the u.s. was likely to increase, and that berlin would discuss the matter with washington. the u.s. has the world’s fourth-largest solar capacity after china, japan and germany. globally, solar capacity soared to almost 400 gw last year from under 10 gw in 2007, according to the international renewable energy administration. the u.s.-based solar energy industries association said the decision could cause the loss of around 23,000 u.s. jobs this year, and result in the delay or cancellation of billions of dollars in solar investments. asia to feel the pain the u.s. government argued that its domestic manufacturers could not compete with what it said were artificially lower-priced asian panels. the chinese firms that are the world’s biggest makers of solar photo-voltaic cells will be hit by the tariffs at their production sites across asia. jack feng, vice president at trina solar, one of china’s top panel makers alongside jinko solar, said his firm would “expand their territory to a broader range in the globe”, including europe, china, indonesia and india. china’s ministry of commerce on tuesday said the decision damaged the global trade environment, and the ministry of industry and information technology said chinese solar companies were likely to curb overseas expansion. “china’s solar industry has been growing at a fast pace in recent years, making itself a target of protectionism in some countries,” it said. solar installers from baker electric place solar panels on the roof of a residential home in scripps ranch, san diego, california, u.s. october 14, 2016. reuters/mike blake/files south korea said it would “actively respond to u.s. trade protectionism”, including exercising its rights under the world trade organization. morgan stanley warned of wider economic damage as the protectionist stance “could challenge investors’ perception whether the u.s. will adhere to current free trade policies”. potential exemptions there is still uncertainty on when the tariffs will be imposed and how the tariff-free imports will be shared out. sma solar said it could not yet make a full assessment but added: “we do not expect a major collapse of the u.s. market.” shares in u.s. panel maker sunpower climbed 0.8 percent on monday and electric car maker tesla, which also produces solar panels, gained 1.5 percent. yet analysts said the benefits for u.s. firms were not clear-cut. “the overwhelming majority of the 260,000 solar jobs in the u.s. depend on the cheaper imported products,” height securities said. goldman sachs estimated that the tariffs implied “a 3-7 percent cost increase for utility-scale and residential solar costs, respectively”. however, there remains the possibility of some manufacturers winning exclusions. “two key exclusions with respect to technology and certain countries (canada/singapore, among others) were included as part of the (initial) recommendation,” goldman sachs said. canadian solar is one the world’s biggest panel manufacturers. in singapore, unlisted rec operates one of the city-state’s biggest manufacturing sites. doran hole, chief executive officer for north america at u.s.-listed renesola, said there may still be ways to settle the trade dispute. “there is quite a bit of discretion about ... negotiations for a settlement. having a global settlement would certainly be useful to the industry as a whole.” additional reporting by jumin park and jane chung in seoul; muyu xu and josephine mason in beijing; david stanway in shanghai; christoph steitz and vera eckert in berlin; nina chestney in london; peter maushagen and alissa de carbonnel in brussels; editing by kevin liffey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"germany 's robert bosch , the world's biggest automotive supplier, is betting on farming technology to boost profit this year as disclosures about experiments by carmakers on monkeys jeopardize diesel-related jobs. the stuttgart-based company said it introduced new smart farming solutions last year, including sensor-based technologies to help farmers cultivate asparagus and strawberries, manage cattle or even to farm oysters. ""the digital agriculture market is expected to grow more than 70 percent by 2020,"" bosch said on tuesday. bosch builds sensors to help farmers measure growth and calibrate fertilizer and pesticide use. it has products to allow ranchers to monitor weight gain in cattle which have significant potential in brazil and the united states, it added. in 2017, bosch posted a 6.7 percent rise in annual revenues to 78 billion euros ($97 billion). industrial technology accounted for 6.7 billion euros of the total, while automotive-related business generated 47.4 billion, with the rest coming from consumer goods and energy and building technology. adjusted earnings before interest and tax (ebit) rose 23 percent to 5.3 billion euros, helping to improve the ebit margin to 6.8 percent from 5.8 percent a year earlier, bosch said. bosch expects to further increase sales and earnings this year, even amid increased geopolitical risks including brexit negotiations and ""unpredictable"" u.s. foreign policy. however, bosch warned that demand for diesel cars had fallen in europe, a trend likely to be exacerbated by revelations that a research group conducted experiments that exposed monkeys and humans to toxic diesel fumes. revenue in the automotive business saw a 7.8 percent rise thanks to sales of driver assistance and infotainment systems and diesel injection systems for commercial vehicles, bosch said. bosch said it expects automotive revenues to outpace weaker growth in global automotive production, thanks to sales of vehicle electrification components, including a 48-volt battery for hybrid vehicles and an electric axle. but ceo denner struck a skeptical tone about the possibility of bosch producing its own electric car battery cells, saying the company would need to spend 20 billion euros to enter the market. ""many unknowns as well as technological and especially market developments can only be predicted with difficulty or high degree of uncertainty,"" denner said, adding that established players are strong. ""since materials costs, including raw materials, are responsible for three quarters of the value created, there only remains a narrow scope for creating and exploiting competitive advantages,"" denner said. whether bosch enters the battery cell manufacturing business is part of a broader effort by the company to continually review its portfolio of assets, it said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"frankfurt/beijing, feb 6 (reuters) - chinese carmaker geely has bought shares in german car and truck maker daimler , two people familiar with the matter told reuters, as the chinese owner of volvo cars seeks to strike an alliance over electric cars technology. the size of the stake remains unclear but is likely to be below 3 percent, as that level would require geely to make a regulatory disclosure in germany. it was also unclear whether geely had sought to buy further shares from existing shareholders in daimler. in november, sources had told reuters that daimler, the parent company of mercedes-benz, turned down an offer from geely to take a stake of up to 5 percent via a discounted share placement. at the time, daimler declined to issue new shares because it did not want to see existing stockholders diluted, sources with knowledge of the talks had said. now sources said that geely has opted to build a stake by buying existing shares. “geely has opted mainly to show their seriousness and to impress on daimler folks that they are not going away,” one of the sources, who declined to be named, said. a spokesman for geely declined to comment. daimler on tuesday reiterated that it would welcome interest from long-term shareholders and added that any significant changes to its shareholder structure would be published on its website. people with knowledge of geely’s thinking had said the company was keen to access daimler’s electric car battery technology and wanted to establish an electric car joint venture in wuhan, the capital of hubei province. carmakers in china have come under pressure to ramp up production of battery electric and hybrid vehicles ahead of tough new quotas to be imposed by beijing, which wants to reduce urban smog and lower the country’s reliance on oil.

0,"frankfurt (reuters) - german solar battery maker sonnen is giving away electric car plugs to new household customers, seeking to attract drivers frustrated by the slow roll-out of shared charging points and link them up to better manage power demand. the venture capital-backed start-up unveiled its 22 kilowatt sonnencharger on thursday for ordering by members of its online energy sharing platform in germany, with first deliveries expected by the end of june. philipp schroeder, one of its managing directors, told reuters the company hoped to create a network of electric vehicle (ev) owners to help manage the charging process and minimise disruption for power grids. “automotive and power network companies will have to solve these problems anyway and we are hoping for partners,” he said. “there will have to be solutions for mass charging, otherwise the move to evs will not work,” he added. worldwide, sonnen has sold 30,000 batteries for storing solar power, mostly to rooftop solar panel owners. its customers have the capacity to generate a combined 210 megawatts of solar power. in its core german market, some 80 to 90 percent of customers are signed up to the sonnencommunity, which shares power production, consumption and storage via data apps. customers that opt for a flat tariff get a guaranteed 8,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of power per year - more than enough for a typical four person household, which uses around 5,000 kwh per year. that potentially leaves them with around 3,000 kwh to charge an ev, equating to a driving range of 15,000-17,000 km. with the ev plug, customers can choose between slow and fast charging and adjust the required volume, helping to reduce the potential run on power during peak loading times that developers of ev infrastructure say could be a problem. sonnen also aims to market unused electricity from community members’ panels to the national power grid to help stabilise supply, and to market their battery capacity to absorb wind power whenever grids are unable to transport it to consumers. “access to car batteries would give us additional storage capacity,” schroeder said, adding this would cut down on the amount of wind power currently left unused at times of grid bottlenecks. sonnen, which sells to foreign markets including italy, the united states and australia, saw a 24 million euro increase in turnover last year to around 65 million euros ($80 million), schroeder said.

1,"san francisco, may 23 (reuters) - immaterial negative news stories about tesla inc have hit a “fever pitch”, and the electric carmaker’s stock is set to surge as output of its model 3 sedan improves, according to an analyst. baird equity research analyst ben kallo, in a note on wednesday, said reports about factory accidents, employee turnover and production pauses have contributed to investor pessimism, but that sentiment would recover as the company fixes factory bottlenecks and increases output of its model 3. “sentiment is as negative as we have experienced around tesla, and we want to lean into the fever pitch,” wrote kallo, one of nine analysts who recommend buying tesla’s stock, according to thomson reuters data. he called the substantial rise of negative tesla headlines over the past month “increasingly immaterial.” another eight analysts recommend selling tesla, and nine have neutral ratings. shares of tesla remain down 9 percent since the silicon valley company reported quarterly financial results on may 2, when chief executive officer elon musk refused to answer questions from analysts about the electric vehicle maker’s capital requirements, saying “boring, bonehead questions are not cool.” musk has repeatedly missed targets for model 3 production, which tesla is banking on to establish itself as a mass market seller of electric cars. tesla’s stock has lost over a quarter of its value since closing at a record high last september. a series of fiery tesla car crashes and executive departures have also worried investors. after consumer reports said on monday that the model 3 had “big flaws”, including braking slower than a full-sized pickup truck, musk responded on twitter that tesla would fix the car’s braking system with a software update. tesla’s stock was off 0.1 percent on wednesday at $274.65. the mean analyst price target for tesla has dipped to $289 from $326 a month ago. kallo’s target of $411 is about 50 percent higher than wednesday’s price. on tesla’s recent quarterly results conference call, kallo commented that the flow of negative news stories about tesla was making it difficult for even “believers” to own the company’s stock. musk responded that investors worried about volatility should steer clear of tesla’s shares.

0,"march 20, 2018 / 7:14 am / updated an hour ago china electric car execs call for policy support, end to protectionism david stanway 4 min read shanghai (reuters) - delegates to china’s annual meeting of parliament have urged the state to provide more policy clarity for the electric car industry and overhaul a local government subsidy program they say has distorted the market. china is aggressively pushing new energy vehicles (nevs) not only to cut smog in congested cities but also as a strategic industry that will help boost its firms’ global presence. it is now moving to make producers more competitive by phasing out subsidies. but industry figures said in proposals submitted during this year’s national people’s congress (npc) that the state still must tackle “protectionist” local governments that dish out extra subsidies and draw up preferential policies aimed at excluding rivals. “although policy direction at the national level is clear, there are still factors at local government level that do not benefit the development of the nev sector or the establishment of a fair, competitive market,” said wang fengying, chief executive of china’s great wall motor co ltd and a delegate with hebei province. she said local governments were using subsidies to protect their own firms rather than stimulate the sector as a whole, and local governments were also adjusting technological standards to shut out rivals. npc delegates also called for more consistent guidelines, nationwide technological standards for batteries as well as cars, and a more finely-tuned system of incentives. current subsidies focused on production, rather than consumption, were counterproductive, some delegates added. china manufactured 794,000 nev units and sold 777,000 in 2017, both the world’s highest and up more than 50 percent on the year. total nev ownership in china reached 1.8 million, more than half the global total. executives said the future of the industry will hinge on improving performance and driver convenience, with battery life, recharging speeds and the availability of recharging stations among the major concerns. they urged government to raise technological thresholds and create incentives to improve battery range. policies were also needed to encourage nev sharing and to grant electric vehicles preferential road access to make them more attractive to consumers. protectionism preferential policies to encourage cleaner electric vehicles are not unique to china, with the likes of united states and norway also offering a wide range of subsidies and incentives such as tax credits for buyers or exemptions from road toll and car registration charges. but in china, intense regional competition means that provinces go the extra mile to encourage production. forced to abandon heavily-polluting industries, china’s regions have turned to clean, state-backed sectors like electric cars for alternative sources of growth. heilongjiang in the northeast was one of several provinces lobbying for more support for its nev industry this year, saying it would help revive china’s old rustbelt region. anhui in eastern china also called for support to establish a nev innovation center. but industry delegates said progress has been impeded by regional efforts to promote local nev champions. “the long-term existence of different types of local protectionism not only leads to low-quality and redundant production and inefficient, wasteful investment,” said delegates from anhui led by zhou fugeng, senior engineer with jianghuai automobiles. “it also severely reduces consumer choice, fragments the market, inhibits innovation and deviates from the state’s original intentions to develop nevs,” they said. china’s subsidy cut is seen as a crucial test of the industry’s ability to stand on its own two feet, but wang of great wall motors said state financial support needed to be targeted more effectively. “a clear requirement is that local governments should not provide subsidies for car purchases, and should convert them into subsidies for usage,” she said. reporting by david stanway; editing by lincoln feast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"I hope you are right, But I don't think that the announcement of HW3 being installed in new cars and the promise of FSD is going to move the needle on sales. What will move sales up is lower prices. The $35k Model 3 was briefly listed and although I am aware it is still technically available most people will be unaware. Tesla has decided that the SR+ at $39,500 is sufficient to bump sales up and I hope they are right. But I think that is limited in increased appeal and they need to keep all the features in the $39.5k version but lower price more. My big hope is that the Maxwell acquisition will go through and this will lead to significant reduction in battery cost that in turn will allow further price reductions of Model 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My sister drives a 1st gen Scion xB (center-mounted speedometer)and I certainly found the Tesla instrumentation easier to deal with than it.I saw an apparently candid photo of a new HUD display posted online just the other day. A photo taken in broad daylight, yet the display was crystal clear and had bright colors. (Wish I could remember where I saw that, so I could copy it here.) I had no idea that HUD tech for civilian vehicles was anywhere near this good.Here's hoping that Tesla starts offering a HUD display in the Model 3, and soon!

1,"hong kong (reuters) - last january, alibaba founder jack ma met with donald trump, then the u.s. president-elect, to discuss helping one million small u.s businesses access chinese consumers through the e-commerce giant’s online platform. a moneygram logo is seen outside a bank in vienna, austria, june 28, 2016. reuters/heinz-peter bader/files trump told reporters that he and ma had a “great meeting” and would do great things together. one year on, however, u.s. security concerns have torpedoed ma’s plans for a $1.2 billion takeover of the dallas-based moneygram international inc (mgi.o) by ant financial, an alibaba affiliate. it was the most high-profile chinese deal yet to fall foul of the committee on foreign investment in the united states (cfius) under the trump administration. the failure has prompted the question among dealmakers: if a jack ma-linked company cannot buy a u.s. company, is there hope for other chinese companies - or should they turn their sights elsewhere? “the regulatory uncertainty will certainly make chinese buyers further head for other countries such as germany, the uk and israel for foreign assets,” said one china-focused m&a lawyer at a global law firm, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to speak with the media. over the past decade, a quarter of all chinese bids for u.s. companies by value have been withdrawn, according to thomson reuters data. that compares with 15 percent for asia-pacific-focused deals and 8 percent in europe. not all of the withdrawals were due to regulatory factors. the largest was the dropping by the chinese insurer anbang of a surprise $15 billion bid for starwood hotels in 2016. but u.s. lawmakers - whose biggest rebuff to china was delivered in 2005, when congressional opposition derailed a $19.5 billion bid for unocal by the chinese state-owned oil major cnooc - have once more become an increasing concern for dealmakers. a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the u.s. senate and house of representatives introduced bills in november to broaden the government’s power to stop foreign purchases of u.s. companies by strengthening cfius, amid growing concerns about chinese efforts to buy u.s. high-tech companies. lawmakers are expected to present a new draft of the bills in march or april and “people are pretty confident” that some form of the bills will be passed, according to a china-based lawyer familiar with cfius matters. a logo of ant financial is displayed at the ant financial event in hong kong, china november 1, 2016. reuters/bobby yip/files rod hunter, a partner with the baker mckenzie law firm and a former official with oversight of cfius cases under the last bush administration, said companies needed to take account of the evolving nature of security concerns and the increasing focus on personal data and emerging technologies. “cfius, by statute, focuses only on national security when reviewing proposed foreign investments, but notions of national security have evolved substantially in recent years,” he said. he added: “from the u.s. government perspective, chinese investment in the united states is made sensitive by the extensive involvement of the chinese communist party and chinese government in the economy.” ant and moneygram terminated their deal after cfius rejected their proposals to address data safety concerns, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions. china adapts the united states has typically attracted relatively little chinese dealmaking due to a mix of regulatory factors and the fierce competition that foreign buyers face from local players. just 18 percent of chinese cross-border deals by value over the past decade have had a u.s. target, compared with 36 percent for europe and 46 percent for asia-pacific. while china dealmakers acknowledged the signal sent by ant’s moneygram failure, most viewed it as a one-off situation. “lots of china’s companies underestimate compliance risk and the complexity of operating in highly regulated u.s. markets, particularly in the finance and fin tech sectors,” said jeffrey sun, partner at law firm orrick, based in shanghai. chinese groups have already begun adapting to the difficulty in getting deals passed. in november, the buyout firm orient hontai capital dropped a $1.4 billion bid for applovin, a u.s. mobile marketing group, because of push back from cfius. instead of equity, it opted to lend the group $841 million. still-pending deals include the $2.7 billion bid by oceanwide holdings for the insurer genworth financial inc, first announced in october 2016. in november last year the pair agreed to extend the deadline for a second time to april 2018 to allow them to amend the deal terms further to satisfy cfius. another high-profile deal before cfius is the purchase by hna group of skybridge capital llc, a hedge fund of funds firm, from anthony scaramucci, the trump administration’s former communications director. others have begun to focus on smaller minority investments - a route taken by tencent, alibaba’s fiercest chinese rival. the shenzhen-based group last year bought a 5 percent stake in the u.s. electric car maker tesla for $1.8 billion. reporting by kane wu and jennifer hughes in hong kong; additional reporting by julie zhu in hong kong and matthew miller in beijing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"(repeats with no changes to text) by steve gorman los angeles, may 11 (reuters) - billionaire businessman elon musk is promising the public “free rides” in the next few months through the first high-speed passenger tunnel drilled beneath los angeles by his aptly named underground transit venture, the boring company. the question is whether the tunnel as advertised by musk on social media will live up to the sensation he stirred by suggesting commuters will soon get to sample a new subterranean traffic system he has under development in the nation’s second-largest city. the tunnel shown in an attention-getting video clip musk posted to instagram on thursday actually runs not under los angeles but beneath the tiny, adjacent municipality of hawthorne, where his boring company and spacex rocket firm are both headquartered. and it was uncertain whether the permits he received from the hawthorne would even allow the public to set foot in the tunnel, originally proposed strictly as an experimental project to test musk’s concepts for a high-speed transit network. “there will be no cars or people in the research tunnel,” according to the minutes of a special hawthorne city council meeting last august to review the proposed easement, or right-of-way, boring sought for the tunnel. musk, who also leads the tesla inc electric car manufacturing company, launched his foray into public transit after he complained on twitter in december 2016 that clogged traffic was “driving me nuts,” vowing then to “build a boring machine and just start digging.” musk maintained his air of bravura in his latest instagram message, which was repeated to his twitter account. “first boring company tunnel under la almost done! pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months,” he wrote. according to public records, boring started with a 350-foot-long tunnel on private property belonging to spacex and later sought the easement to extend the tunnel another 2 miles underground beneath hawthorne city streets. boring has since sought approval to dig a similar experimental tunnel that would run for 2.7 miles beneath the busy west side of los angeles proper but has yet to break ground there. both plans were pitched as first steps toward developing a subterranean network of tunnels envisioned by musk for rapidly whisking car and pedestrian traffic within and between cities to ease road congestion at the surface. “super huge thanks to everyone that helped with this project,” musk said in his social media messages. “as mentioned in prior posts, once fully operational (demo system rides will be free), the system will always give priority to pods for pedestrians & cyclists for less than the cost of a bus ticket.” the message accompanied a fast-forward video of the tunnel’s interior shot by a camera traveling the length of the cylindrical passageway, well lit and roughly 12 feet in diameter. a man in a hard hat is seen working at one end of apparently unfinished underground tube. musk was not available for comment. jehn hemme, a spokeswoman for boring, declined to comment when asked to clarify musk’s instagram post and what the video actually depicted. while musk referred to the tunnel as the first his company has excavated under “la”, the footage is from the existing tunnel in hawthorne, said alison simard, a spokeswoman for los angeles city councilman paul koretz, who has supported boring’s request to fast-track approval of a los angeles test tunnel. she said there was nothing in that request, which city council’s public works committee approved in april, that would allow public entry into a test tunnel. hawthorne city officials were not available for comment; city offices there are typically closed on fridays.

Thus even at a final production rate of 10k a week which I imagine Tesla will hit some time in 2019 or 2020, there will be such a huge backlog that it will take them another couple years to get through it and begin taking orders with similar wait time as one would have buying a Model S or X today.In other words, my question is: when will regular car buyers be able to test drive a Model 3, configure one, and purchase one without needing to wait months or years before it's ready?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"fergus falls, minn., feb. 12, 2018 (globe newswire) -- otter tail corporation (nasdaq:ottr) today announced financial results for the year ended december 31, 2017. 2017 summary: 4q17 4q16 2017 2016 operating revenues (in millions) $ 206.7 $ 196.6 $ 849.3 $ 803.5 diluted earnings per share – continuing operations $ 0.45 $ 0.44 $ 1.81 $ 1.60 add back: impact of tax reform 0.05 -- 0.05 -- adjusted diluted earnings per share – continuing operations 1 $ 0.50 $ 0.44 $ 1.86 $ 1.60 2017 highlights consolidated net income from continuing operations increased to $72.1 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, from $62.0 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, in 2016. consolidated net income totaled $72.4 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared with $62.3 million and $1.61 per diluted share for 2016. the corporation’s board of directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.335 per share, an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.34 per share. this is a $0.06 per share increase over the 2017 rate. the dividend is payable on march 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on february 15, 2018. the corporation expects 2018 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $1.80 to $1.95. 1 this release includes measures of financial performance and presentations of financial information that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). management believes that presenting consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share and net income by segment on a non-gaap basis by excluding the impact of the 2017 tax reform tax rate reduction on deferred tax values from consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share and net income by segment will assist investors in making an evaluation of our performance against prior periods on a comparable basis. management understands that there are material limitations on the use of non-gaap measures. non-gaap measures are not substitutes for gaap measures for the purpose of analyzing financial performance. these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. in addition, these non-gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. this information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results, which have been determined and provided in accordance with gaap. ceo overview “our dedicated employees again proved to be our strongest asset as they delivered 2017 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.81,” said president and ceo chuck macfarlane. “these excellent results include a positive $0.09 per diluted share estimated impact from our plastics segment’s response to hurricane-related market dynamics. “our results also include a reduction of $0.05 per diluted share from a change in value of net deferred tax assets related to the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law on december 22, 2017. this reduction from the new tax law was not contemplated when we updated our 2017 diluted earnings per share guidance to $1.75 - $1.85. our adjusted diluted earnings per share before the tax impact was $1.86. “operationally, otter tail power company continued its strong performance, equaling 2016 for its lowest number of osha recordable injuries on record and continuing high customer satisfaction scores as measured by j.d. power and associates. “otter tail power company also made excellent progress on two key growth projects in 2017: big stone south-brookings and big stone south-ellendale, two 345 kilovolt transmission projects that the midcontinent independent system operator has designated as multi-value projects. we are a 50 percent owner in both projects. the big stone south-brookings project was completed in september on time and under budget. the big stone south-ellendale project, which otter tail power company manages, is scheduled for completion in 2019. otter tail expects its investment in the two projects to be approximately $200 million. “looking forward, otter tail power company has a strong rate base growth plan driven by our renewable energy and natural gas generation projects. both projects made good progress in their development in 2017. the minnesota public utilities commission approved our resource plan and the north dakota public service commission granted advance determinations of prudence for the merricourt wind and astoria natural gas-fired generation projects. overall, otter tail power company plans to spend approximately $901 million on capital projects from 2018 through 2022, including these investments in renewable energy, natural gas-fired generation and regional transmission projects. “tax reform will benefit otter tail power company’s rate base growth. prior to tax reform, we were forecasting a 7.2 percent compound annual growth rate between 2016 and 2021. with tax reform we are projecting this will move to 9.0 percent for the timeframe 2017 through 2022. “also important is a positive outcome in the rate case otter tail power company filed with the north dakota public service commission in november, seeking permission to increase non-fuel base rates by approximately $13 million, or 8.72 percent. the north dakota public service commission granted an 8.64 percent interim rate increase beginning january 1, 2018, while it considers the overall request. we expect an adjustment related to tax reform legislation and a final determination by the end of this year. “business conditions are showing signs of improvement for our manufacturing companies. “btd manufacturing, our custom metal fabricator, achieved year-over-year net earnings improvement. the company’s customer base in agriculture, energy, and recreational utility vehicles has begun to show economic recovery. “t. o. plastics, our plastics thermoforming manufacturer, achieved 8 percent overall revenue growth from increased sales through deeper penetration into its primary market, horticulture containers, and a renewed focus on the life sciences market. “northern pipe products and vinyltech, our pvc pipe manufacturing companies, sold more pounds and earned higher margins, partly due to the previously mentioned hurricane-related market dynamics, which we do not expect to repeat in 2018. but general market conditions for pvc pipe also improved, and our pipe manufacturers are efficient, low cost operators. “our strategic initiatives to grow our businesses, achieve operational and commercial excellence, and develop our talent are strengthening our position in the markets we serve. we remain confident in our ability to grow earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of 4 to 7 percent compounded annually from $1.81 in 2017, the base year.” cash flow from operations and liquidity the corporation’s consolidated net cash provided by continuing operations in 2017 was $173.6 million compared with $163.5 million in 2016. the $10.1 million increase in cash provided by continuing operations between the years includes a $10.1 million increase in net income from continuing operations and a $10.0 million reduction in discretionary contributions to our pension plan. changes in long-term assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes, totaling $17.4 million were more than offset by a $27.0 million increase in cash used for working capital items. the increase in cash used for working capital between the periods is primarily due to a $19.1 million increase in cash used for payables and other current liabilities between the years at otter tail power company related to the timing of payments as cash use decreased $10.3 million in 2016 compared to an increase of $8.8 million in cash used for payables and other current liabilities in 2017. cash used for inventories increased $6.2 million between the years primarily due to increased levels of inventory in each of our business segments. the following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of december 31, 2017: (in

recovery of increased fuel and purchased power costs due to a 1.4% increase in kwhs sold and a 4.8% increase in fuel and purchased power costs per kwh. a $4.2 million increase in minnesota base rate revenue mainly due to the transfer of recovery of environmental and transmission costs and investments from riders to base rates. a $2.0 million increase in revenues due to increased consumption related to colder weather in 2017 reflected in the 11.6% increase in heating degree days between the years. a $1.0 million increase in north dakota transmission cost recovery (tcr) rider revenues as a result of increased investment in transmission assets qualifying for revenue recovery through the tcr rider. offset by: a $7.1 million reduction in minnesota environmental cost recovery (ecr) rider and tcr rider revenues due to the transfer of qualifying costs from rider recovery into base rates, and due to declining revenue requirements related to lower asset values due to accumulated depreciation. additionally, a lower return on equity in the midcontinent independent system operator (miso) transmission tariff related to complaints currently under judicial review resulted in lower tcr revenues in minnesota. a $3.7 million decrease in minnesota conservation improvement program (mncip) incentive and cost recovery revenues related to a $2.5 million reduction in incentives earned due to lower incentive rates and a $1.2 million reduction in spending on mncip programs. in 2017 otter tail power company began operating under a new mncip program that was authorized by the minnesota public utilities commission. this new program lowered the incentive payout by 50% in 2017. the $1.2 million reduction in spending was due to a delay in regulatory approval for the implementation of an led streetlight project. a $1.9 million decrease in revenue due to a change in estimate that reduced unbilled revenues. a $1.5 million decrease in north dakota and south dakota ecr rider revenues resulting from lower values on qualifying assets due to accumulated depreciation. a $0.6 million increase in revenue from wholesale electric sales from company-owned generation was mostly offset by a $0.4 million increase in fuel costs for wholesale generation. other electric revenues increased $8.2 million as a result of: a $7.8 million increase in miso transmission tariff revenues, mainly driven by increased investment in regional transmission lines and revenues earned from the use of those lines by other electric service providers. a $0.4 million increase in other revenues, mainly steam sales at big stone plant. production fuel costs increased $4.9 million as a result of a 4.0% increase in kwhs generated. this was due to increased generation from coyote station and hoot lake plant because of coyote station’s greater availability, increased demand due to colder weather in 2017 and higher market prices for electricity that resulted in increased dispatch of hoot lake plant. the cost of purchased power to serve retail customers increased $1.6 million despite a 3.4% decrease in kwhs purchased. this was a result of higher market prices for electricity driven by increased demand in 2017 due, in part, to colder weather in 2017 than in 2016. electric operating and maintenance expenses increased $0.1 million as a result of: a $3.2 million increase in labor and benefit costs due to increased wages and higher medical benefit payments. offset by: a $1.2 million decrease in transmission expenditures to independent system operators in 2017. a $1.2 million decrease in mncip expenditures due to a delay in regulatory approval of an led streetlight project planned for 2017. a $0.7 million net reduction in other operating expenses. depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million due to lower depreciation rates. property tax expense increased $0.8 million mainly due to transmission line additions in south dakota related to the construction of the big stone south-ellendale and big stone south-brookings 345-kv transmission projects. electric segment income tax expenses increased $0.6 million, mainly due to $0.5 million in tax expense resulting from

(btd), revenues increased $5.9 million. this is due to a $3.3 million increase in product sales to manufacturers of recreational and lawn and garden equipment from btd’s minnesota and georgia manufacturing facilities offset by lower sales in the energy end-use market at the illinois facility. scrap revenues increased $2.6 million due to higher volume and higher scrap-metal prices. cost of products sold increased $2.3 million and operating expenses increased $1.8 million between the years. collectively, these items resulted in improved operating margins of $1.9 million in 2017 compared with 2016. a $1.4 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the december 2016 refinancing of long-term debt at lower interest rates was mostly offset by a $1.0 million increase in income tax expense. this resulted in a $2.3 million increase in year-over-year income at btd before recording the effects of $2.6 million in tax savings related to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities as a result of lower tax rates from tax reform. at t.o. plastics, inc. (t.o. plastics), revenues increased $2.5 million, including increases of $1.3 million from sales of life science products, $1.0 million from sales of horticultural products and $0.2 million from sales of industrial products. costs of products sold increased $2.4 million due to the increase in sales while operating expenses decreased $0.1 million. depreciation expense was down $0.3 million due to certain assets reaching the ends of their depreciable lives in 2017. a $0.3 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the december 2016 refinancing of long-term debt at lower interest rates was more than offset by a $0.4 million increase in income tax expense related to a $0.8 million increase in income before income taxes, resulting in a $0.4 million increase in year-over-year income at

increase in pounds of polyvinyl chloride (pvc) pipe sold and an 11.5% increase in pvc pipe prices between the years. cost of products sold increased $16.6 million due to the increase in sales volume and a 5.9% increase in the cost per pound of pipe sold. year-over-year improvement in our normal business operations provided approximately $4.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, of the segment’s increase in net income. the remaining increase in net income and earnings per diluted share is due to two items. first, increased sales and pricing were affected by hurricanes in the gulf coast region of the united states, where the major u.s. resin production plants are located. major resin suppliers shut down production facilities which impacted raw material availability. distributors and contractors became concerned about pipe availability. this accelerated pipe demand and created positive sales price pressure in the market. even though hurricanes impacted raw material availability, our pipe companies had sufficient raw materials to run their plants and meet the additional demand. the impact of hurricane harvey on 2017 net income and diluted earnings per share is estimated to be $3.4 million and $0.09, respectively. second, the plastics segment recorded $3.3 million in tax savings, $0.08 in diluted earnings per share, related to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities as a result of lower tax rates from tax reform. corporate (in thousands) 2017 2016 change % change net loss $ (10,073 ) $ (4,114 ) $ (5,959 ) 144.8 add back: impact of tax reform (7,198 ) -- (7,198 ) --

the increase in fourth quarter 2017 net income from continuing operations compared with the fourth quarter 2016 was driven by improved results in our plastics and manufacturing segments. plastics plastics segment net income increased $5.9 million, which includes a $3.3 million reduction in income tax expense due to tax reform. plastics segment net income before the impact of tax reform 1 increased $2.6 million due to a 26.2% increase in revenue per pound of pvc pipe sold, offset by a 4.3% decrease in pounds of pipe sold. the increase in pvc pipe prices was partially offset by an 11.1% increase in the cost per pound of pipe sold. pipe prices were up at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017 due to increased demand resulting from third quarter 2017 hurricanes in the gulf coast region of the united states. cost of goods sold increased $1.5 million as a result of higher resin prices. operating expenses increased $1.3 million, mainly due to increased incentives earned related to 2017 financial performance. manufacturing manufacturing segment net income increased $4.7 million, which includes a $2.6 million reduction in income tax expense at btd due to tax reform. manufacturing segment net income before the impact of tax reform 1 increased $2.1 million between the quarters due to improved quarter over quarter performance at btd. revenues at btd increased $6.4 million due to increased product sales in minnesota and georgia to manufacturers of recreational and lawn and garden equipment and also due to $0.7 million in increased scrap revenues related to increased volume and higher scrap-metal prices. net income at btd before the impact of tax reform 1 increased $2.4 million as a result of increased sales volume, while net income at t.o. plastics decreased $0.3 million. electric electric segment net income decreased $2.7 million, which includes a $0.5 million increase in income tax expense due to tax reform. electric segment net income before the impact of tax reform 1 decreased $2.3 million between the quarters. operating revenues decreased $3.4 million as a result of the following: a $3.5 million increase in miso transmission tariff revenues driven by increased investment in regional transmission lines and revenues earned from the use of those lines by other electric service providers. a $1.6 million increase in retail revenues due to colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2017. a $0.8 million increase in retail revenues due to increases in residential and industrial kwh sales. a $0.5 million increase in other electric revenues, mainly steam sales at big stone plant. a $0.4 million increase in revenue from a 27.4% increase in wholesale kwh sales. offset by a $6.3 million decrease in retail revenues due to a change in estimate that reduced unbilled revenues by $1.9 million and a reduction in revenue related to the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs of $4.4 million. a $2.7 million decrease in mncip incentive and cost recovery revenues related to a $1.7 million reduction in incentives earned due to lower incentive rates and a $1.0 million reduction in spending on mncip programs. a $1.3 million decrease in net revenue due to receiving higher interim rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with revenue under final rates that went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2017. fuel and purchased power costs to serve retail customers decreased $3.8 million, mainly as a result of a reduction in kwhs purchased, while fuel costs for wholesale sales increased $0.4 million as a result of the increase in wholesale kwh sales. electric segment operating expenses increased $2.8 million, including: a $1.1 million increase in medical insurance costs. a $0.7 million increase in material and supply costs. a $0.5 million increase in transmission service expenses. a $0.3 million increase in property tax expense mainly due to transmission asset additions in south dakota related to the construction of the big stone south-ellendale and big stone south-brookings 345 kv transmission projects. a $1.0 million decrease in mncip costs offset by $1.0 million increase in various other expenses, including rate-case-related expenses. corporate corporate net losses increased by $7.2 million. the entire increase in net losses resulted from a $7.2 million increase in income tax expense due to tax reform. tax reform deferred tax assets and liabilities were reduced in value as a result of the tax rate reduction included in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. following is the impact by segment on income tax expense for the quarter ended december 31, 2017: (in thousands) decrease/(increase) electric $ (458 ) manufacturing 2,637 plastics 3,263 corporate (7,198 ) total $ (1,756 ) 2018 business outlook we anticipate 2018 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.95. this guidance reflects the current mix of businesses we own, strategies for improving future operating results, the cyclical nature of some of our businesses, and current regulatory factors and economic challenges facing our electric, manufacturing and plastics segments. due to the tax rate reduction in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, we expect 2018 earnings for our manufacturing and plastics segments to be positively impacted by $0.09 per share offset by $0.04 per share in our corporate cost center. we expect capital expenditures for 2018 to be $110 million compared with actual cash used for capital expenditures of $133 million in 2017. our planned expenditures for 2018 include $33 million for the big stone south-ellendale transmission line project, which positively impacts earnings by providing an immediate return on invested funds through rider recovery mechanisms. segment components of our 2018 earnings per share guidance range compared with 2017 actual earnings are as follows: 2017 eps by segment 2018 eps guidance gaap- basis impact of tax reform before impact of tax reform 1 low high electric $1.24 $0.02 $1.26 $1.34 $1.37 manufacturing $0.28 ($0.07) $0.21 $0.26 $0.30 plastics $0.54 ($0.08) $0.46 $0.36 $0.40 corporate ($0.25) $0.18 ($0.07) ($0.16) ($0.12) total – continuing operations $1.81 $0.05 $1.86 $1.80 $1.95 return on equity 10.6% 10.8% 10.1% 10.9% contributing to our earnings guidance for 2018 are the following items: • we expect 2018 electric segment net income to be higher than 2017 segment net income based on: normal weather for 2018. milder than normal weather in 2017 negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by an estimated $0.04 compared to normal. constructive outcome of a rate case filed in north dakota on november 2, 2017 with a full year of increased interim rates in 2018. our ability to obtain final rates similar to interim rates and reasonable rates of return depends on regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations. we expect the effects of any reduction in interim or final rates as a result of lower tax rates in the new tax law to be offset by lower tax expenses. we cannot provide assurance our interim rates will become final. increase in transmission investments and other revenues. offset by: increased operating and maintenance expenses due to a planned maintenance outage at our big stone plant of $0.05 per share and $0.09 for increasing costs of pension, medical, workers compensation and retiree medical benefits. the increase in pension costs is a result of a decrease in the discount rate from 4.60% to 3.90%. higher depreciation and property tax expense due to large capital projects being put into service. increased interest expense related to replacing short-term debt at an average annual rate of 2.4% with long-term debt at rate of 4.07% along with an increase in combined short-term and long-term borrowings to finance a portion of 2018 planned capital expenditures. • we expect 2018 net income from our manufacturing segment to increase over 2017 based on the following: sales at btd manufacturing are expected to be flat year over year, however, earnings are expected to improve based on stronger year-over-year operating margins achieved through cost reductions and improved productivity. an increase in earnings from t.o. plastics mainly driven by year-over-year sales growth in our horticulture, life science and industrial markets. lower income taxes of approximately $0.04 per share as a result of the lower federal tax rates implemented as part of the new tax law. backlog for the manufacturing companies of approximately $166 million for 2018 compared with $118 million one year ago. • we expect 2018 net income from the plastics segment to be lower than 2017 because 2017 results included sales driven by customer reaction to the hurricanes that occurred in the gulf of mexico. this had an estimated impact on earnings of $0.09 per diluted share in 2017. we also expect lower operating margins in 2018 due to lower expected sales prices and increasing resin prices on similar sales volumes in 2018 compared to 2017 excluding the effect of the hurricanes on 2017 sales. plastics net income for 2018 will be positively affected by lower effective tax rates in 2018 as a result of the new tax law. • corporate costs, net of tax, are expected to be higher in 2018 than in 2017 when excluding the effect of tax reform on 2017 net losses in the corporate cost center. the higher net-of-tax costs expected in 2018 are due, in part, to the lower tax rate that will be in effect in 2018. the impact of 2017 tax reform legislation on future results is based on reasonable estimates reflecting the anticipated impact of tax reform, and is subject to adjustment upon obtaining additional information or to reflect future changes resulting from future legislation, rules, regulations or interpretations impacting tax reform. we will continue to analyze the impact of the 2017 tax reform legislation to assess the full effects on our future business and results. the

based on the need for additional wind and solar in rate base and capital spending for astoria station, a natural gas-fired plant that is expected to replace hoot lake plant when it is retired in 2021. given the increased capital expenditure plan, our compounded annual growth rate in rate base is projected to be 9.0% over the 2017 to 2022 timeframe. execution on the currently anticipated electric utility capital expenditure plan is expected to grow rate base and be a key driver in increasing utility earnings over the 2018 through 2022 timeframe. conference call and webcast the corporation will

1, our ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected. disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact our results of operations, the ability of customers to finance purchases of goods and services, and our financial condition, as well as exert downward pressure on stock prices and/or limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level. we could be required to contribute additional capital to the pension plan in the future if the market value of pension plan assets significantly declines, plan assets do not earn in line with our long-term rate of return assumptions or relief under the pension protection act is no longer granted. any significant impairment of our goodwill would cause a decrease in our asset values and a reduction in our net operating income. declines in projected operating cash flows at btd or the plastics segment may result in goodwill impairments that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, as well as financing agreement covenants. the inability of our subsidiaries to provide sufficient earnings and cash flows to allow us to meet our financial obligations and debt covenants and pay dividends to our shareholders could have an adverse effect on us. we rely on our information systems to conduct our business and failure to protect these systems against security breaches or cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations. additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed. economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses. if we are unable to achieve the organic growth we expect, our financial performance may be adversely affected. our plans to grow and realign our business mix through capital projects, acquisitions and dispositions may not be successful, which could result in poor financial performance. we may, from time to time, sell assets to provide capital to fund investments in our electric utility business or for other corporate purposes, which could result in the recognition of a loss on the sale of any assets sold and other potential liabilities. the sale of any of our businesses could expose us to additional risks associated with indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreements and any related disputes. significant warranty claims and remediation costs in excess of amounts normally reserved for such items could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to risks associated with energy markets. changes in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. four of our operating companies have single customers that provide a significant portion of the individual operating company’s and the business segment’s revenue. the loss of, or significant reduction in revenue from, any one of these customers would have a significant negative financial impact on the operating company and its business segment, and could have a significant negative financial impact on us. we may experience fluctuations in revenues and expenses related to our electric operations, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate and could impair our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or scheduled payments on our debt obligations, or to meet covenants under our borrowing agreements. actions by the regulators of our electric operations could result in rate reductions, lower revenues and earnings or delays in recovering capital expenditures. otter tail power company’s operations are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. otter tail power company’s electric transmission and generation facilities could be vulnerable to cyber and physical attack that could impair its ability to provide electrical service to its customers or disrupt the u.s. bulk power system. otter tail power company’s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs. changes to regulation of generating plant emissions, including but not limited to carbon dioxide emissions, could affect our operating costs and the costs of supplying electricity to our customers. competition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, the price and availability of raw materials, prices and supply of scrap or recyclable material and general economic conditions could affect the revenues and earnings of our manufacturing businesses. our plastics operations are highly dependent on a limited number of vendors for pvc resin and a limited supply of resin. the loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of pvc resin, could result in reduced sales or increased costs for this segment. we compete against a large number of other manufacturers of pvc pipe and manufacturers of alternative products. customers may not distinguish the pipe companies’ products from those of our competitors. changes in pvc resin prices can negatively affect our plastics business. for a further discussion of other risk factors and cautionary statements, refer to reports we file with the securities and exchange commission. about the corporation: otter tail corporation has interests in diversified operations that include an electric utility and manufacturing

1,"rio de janeiro (reuters) - vale sa, the world’s top iron ore producer, expects iron ore prices no lower than $70 per tonne this year and will hand out $1 billion in dividends each quarter this year if conditions remain similar ahead, executives said on thursday. the dividend policy “was constructed to work in any price scenario. that means this policy is here to stay,” chief executive officer fabio schvartsman said on a conference call, adding that a $1 billion dividend payout was already guaranteed for the second quarter. the comments came a day after vale reported a first-quarter slide in profit of 36 percent on higher costs and lower iron ore prices. vale still promised a minimum payout of $1 billion in dividends for the quarter to be paid later this year. vale executives also said they hoped to find a partner for the struggling new caledonia nickel mine by the end of the year, but it was not clear whether the world’s largest nickel producer would continue nickel operations there. executives said they were not satisfied with nickel prices, but said that the metal would become an industry motor when electric vehicles become a reality. vale has struggled over its presence in the nickel segment, where prices have yet to pick up because of oversupply, despite the metal’s key role in lithium-ion batteries that are used in electric cars. over-budget and years late when it started up in 2010, the new caledonia project, located on a pacific island, accumulated nearly $1.3 billion in losses from 2014 to 2016. however, thanks to higher nickel and cobalt prices, the company posted $28 million in first quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) at the mine, its best showing ever. in december, vale dialed back nickel output forecasts for the following five years even as it praised the metal’s future prospects. on thursday, vale said it was curbing base metal production to boost returns, though the world’s biggest nickel producer hopes the area will one day represent a greater part of earnings. vale, also the world’s largest iron ore producer, said it will not flood the market with ore from its carajas mine, adding that the s11d mine would double production this year over last thanks to its continuing ramp-up. vale’s high-quality ore is seen commanding strong demand in china, which aims to curb pollution fanned by making steel from lower-quality ore. reporting by marta nogueira and alexandra alper; editing by chizu nomiyama, phil berlowitz and jonathan oatis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"with its eye on accelerating cost cuts, ford announced first-quarter earnings that topped analyst expectations, and offered up some detail on the steps it will take to improve its financial health and realign its portfolio with a dramatic shift in consumer tastes. like many of its peers, ford has faced declining demand for its passenger cars, and on wednesday said it will not invest in next-generation models of its traditional sedans for north america. within the next few years, the only two cars ford will make will be the mustang and a new focus active crossover, scheduled to debut next year. the other 90 percent of its north american portfolio will be made up of trucks and suvs by 2020. ford is now aiming to hit a pretax profit margin target of 8 percent by 2020, two years earlier than it previously planned, by slashing $25.5 billion in costs and $5 billion in capital spending. ""we are going to be fit across our entire business,"" said ceo jim hackett on a conference call wednesday evening. he added that the company will release further details in the coming months and at an investor meeting on sept. 26. here's how the company did compared with what wall street expected: earnings: 43 cents per share vs. 41 cents per share forecast by thomson reuters revenue: $41.96 billion vs. $37.16 billion forecast by thomson reuters first-quarter net income was $1.74 billion, or 43 cents per share. that is slightly higher than the first quarter of last year, when ford earned $1.59 billion, or 40 cents a share. it also topped analyst estimates of 41 cents per share, according to thomson reuters. ford reported $41.96 billion in revenue, up 7 percent from $39.15 billion a year ago and higher than the $37.16 billion analysts were expecting. the company, which is the no. 2 u.s. automaker behind general motors , was hurt by rising commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates in the latest quarter. but sales of high-margin pickup trucks and suvs helped boost its performance. in north america, ford's market share declined by just over 0.5 percent and profit margins declined just over a percentage point to 7.8 percent, which ford blamed on the higher commodity costs. in south america, ford posted an ebit loss of $149 million, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of losses in the region. despite the loss, key metrics improved in the region, due to economic recoveries in brazil and argentina. european revenues were up 18 percent, fueled by exchange rates and higher pricing, but margins were down 1.5 percentage points to 1.3 percent for the region. the middle east and africa region saw an ebit loss of $54 million, but metrics did improve for the fourth consecutive quarter. the asia pacific region incurred an ebit loss of $119 million, which ford blamed on its business in china. but losses were partially offset by profits elsewhere in the region. india improved but still posted a slight loss. ford said it strengthened its relationship with mahindra group, and the two will collaborate on new suvs and electric vehicles for india and other emerging markets. ford's mobility business, which is tasked with investing in autonomous driving and other mobility technologies and business opportunities, posted higher losses than the same quarter last year. ford credit saw earnings before taxes rise 33 percent over the same quarter last year, to $641 million, but the company now expects full-year ebt to be flat or lower than last year. the earnings beat was positive overall, and it was helpful to hear details on how ford plans to improve its finances, said jeff windau, an analyst for edward jones. but there still are a lot of questions. ""it is positive they are taking the steps to communicate the details of the direction they are taking,"" he said. ""but it is going to be challenging. they are going to be making cost reductions as they are developing these new platforms and new technologies. they are trying to move some pretty big rocks all at the same time.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"(recasts with delay of volume production, updates shares) san francisco, jan 3 (reuters) - tesla inc delayed a production target for its new model 3 sedan for the second time on wednesday, disappointing investors even as it claimed ""major progress"" overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicle's rollout. the electric vehicle maker headed by elon musk said it would likely build about 2,500 model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. instead, tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. the delay sent shares of the palo alto, california-based company down 1.8 percent in after-market trading. the model 3 is critical to tesla's long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market. building the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders. in delivering 1,550 of its new model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, tesla fell short of wall street expectations. analysts had expected 4,100 model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm factset. the estimates for model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. while evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, cowen analysts expected just 2,250. tesla said 860 model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter. the company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 model s vehicles and 13,120 model x cars. analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000. tesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in december, but in november deferred the target to the end of the first quarter. ""in the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 model 3s per week,"" tesla said in a statement. the model 3 starts at $35,000 or about half the price of its flagship model s and over 500,000 customers have put down a refundable deposit for the car.

""we're really more looking at the fire aspects,"" ntsb chairman robert sumwalt told reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck.  tesla did not immediately comment on the august incident.  the ntsb previously said it also is probing an incident in which a tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in california in january.  the law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system.  ""(our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,"" minami said.  while sympathizing with the family, tesla again blamed huang, saying he was well aware that autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged autopilot.  tesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned huang several times on the day of the crash to do so.

0,"san francisco (reuters) - two u.s. consumer advocacy groups urged the federal trade commission on wednesday to investigate what they called tesla inc’s “deceptive and misleading” use of the name autopilot for its assisted-driving technology. an advertisement promotes tesla autopilot at a showroom of u.s. car manufacturer tesla in zurich, switzerland march 28, 2018. reuters/arnd wiegmann/files the center for auto safety and consumer watchdog, both non-profit groups, sent a letter to the ftc saying that consumers could be misled into thinking, based on tesla’s marketing and advertising, that autopilot makes a tesla vehicle self-driving. autopilot, released in 2015, is an enhanced cruise-control system that partially automates steering and braking. tesla states in its owner’s manual and in disclaimers that when the system is engaged, a driver must keep hands on the wheel at all times while using autopilot. “the feedback that we get from our customers shows that they have a very clear understanding of what autopilot is, how to properly use it, and what features it consists of,” a tesla spokesperson said. but in the letter, the groups said that a series of ads and press releases from tesla as well as statements by the company’s chief executive, elon musk, “mislead and deceive customers into believing that autopilot is safer and more capable than it is known to be.” “tesla is the only automaker to market its level 2 vehicles as ‘self-driving’, and the name of its driver assistance suite of features, autopilot, connotes full autonomy,” the letter read. “the burden now falls on the ftc to investigate tesla’s unfair and deceptive practices so that consumers have accurate information, understand the limitations of autopilot, and conduct themselves appropriately and safely,” it read. tesla has also faced criticism from an influential magazine, consumer reports, over braking flaws in its model 3 sedan, which is seen as key to the company’s profitability. musk has promised a quick fix. meanwhile, the popularity of the model 3 has led to more registrations in california for the first quarter than class rivals bmw 3-series and mercedes c-class, according to the california new car dealers association (cncda). california is a key market for global luxury vehicle brands not just because of its size, but because other markets often follow trends set by wealthy consumers in the state. several crashes and fire incidents involving a tesla car this year has been a constant headache for musk, who boasts that his company’s cars are among the safest in the industry. two u.s. tesla drivers have died in crashes in which autopilot was engaged. the most recent crash, in march, is being investigated by safety regulators. tesla has said the use of autopilot results in 40 percent fewer crashes, a claim the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration repeated in a 2017 report on the first fatality, which occurred in may 2016. earlier this month, however, the agency said regulators had not assessed the effectiveness of the technology. last month, another group, consumers union, the advocacy division of consumer reports, called on tesla to improve the safety of its autopilot system. shares of tesla rose 0.5 percent to $276.40 on wednesday. tesla motors' mass-market model 3 electric cars are seen in this handout picture from tesla motors on march 31, 2016. reuters/tesla motors/handout via reuters/files additional reporting by sonam rai in bengaluru; editing by leslie adler, bernard orr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"may 12, 2018 / 7:23 am / updated 7 hours ago elon musk promises free rides through tunnel, but to where? steve gorman 4 min read los angeles (reuters) - billionaire businessman elon musk is promising the public “free rides” in the next few months through the first high-speed passenger tunnel drilled beneath los angeles by his aptly named underground transit venture, the boring company. elon musk arrives at the metropolitan museum of art costume institute gala (met gala) to celebrate the opening of ""heavenly bodies: fashion and the catholic imagination"" in the manhattan borough of new york, u.s., may 7, 2018. reuters/brendan mcdermid the question is whether the tunnel as advertised by musk on social media will live up to the sensation he stirred by suggesting commuters will soon get to sample a new subterranean traffic system he has under development in the nation’s second-largest city. the tunnel shown in an attention-getting video clip musk posted to instagram on thursday actually runs not under los angeles but beneath the tiny, adjacent municipality of hawthorne, where his boring company and spacex rocket firm are both headquartered. and it was uncertain whether the permits he received from the hawthorne would even allow the public to set foot in the tunnel, originally proposed strictly as an experimental project to test musk’s concepts for a high-speed transit network. “there will be no cars or people in the research tunnel,” according to the minutes of a special hawthorne city council meeting last august to review the proposed easement, or right-of-way, boring sought for the tunnel. musk, who also leads the tesla inc electric car manufacturing company, launched his foray into public transit after he complained on twitter in december 2016 that clogged traffic was “driving me nuts,” vowing then to “build a boring machine and just start digging.” musk maintained his air of bravura in his latest instagram message, which was repeated to his twitter account. “first boring company tunnel under la almost done! pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months,” he wrote. according to public records, boring started with a 350-foot-long tunnel on private property belonging to spacex and later sought the easement to extend the tunnel another 2 miles underground beneath hawthorne city streets. boring has since sought approval to dig a similar experimental tunnel that would run for 2.7 miles beneath the busy west side of los angeles proper but has yet to break ground there. both plans were pitched as first steps towards developing a subterranean network of tunnels envisioned by musk for rapidly whisking car and pedestrian traffic within and between cities to ease road congestion at the surface. “super huge thanks to everyone that helped with this project,” musk said in his social media messages. “as mentioned in prior posts, once fully operational (demo system rides will be free), the system will always give priority to pods for pedestrians & cyclists for less than the cost of a bus ticket.” the message accompanied a fast-forward video of the tunnel’s interior shot by a camera travelling the length of the cylindrical passageway, well lit and roughly 12 feet in diameter. a man in a hard hat is seen working at one end of apparently unfinished underground tube. musk was not available for comment. jehn hemme, a spokeswoman for boring, declined to comment when asked to clarify musk’s instagram post and what the video actually depicted. while musk referred to the tunnel as the first his company has excavated under “la”, the footage is from the existing tunnel in hawthorne, said alison simard, a spokeswoman for los angeles city councilman paul koretz, who has supported boring’s request to fast-track approval of a los angeles test tunnel. she said there was nothing in that request, which city council’s public works committee approved in april, that would allow public entry into a test tunnel. hawthorne city officials were not available for comment; city offices there are typically closed on fridays. reporting by steve gorman; editing by bill tarrant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"Rothore) to the Model S and X, of course I can't find it now (read it on Apple News which has no history function).Anyway, that same article said that a powertrain update would also be coming to Model 3 in the next few months as well.Has anyone heard about this possible powertrain update Does that article's claim have any merit?I haven't seen/heard that news. The Model 3 very recently got an upgrade to enable faster DC fast charging, so I'm surprised that yet another one is in the works soon.However, Elon did say a few months back that they had figured out an innovation for the Standard Range Model 3 battery pack; new architecture which would allow lower pack-level costs. It seems reasonable to think Tesla would want to introduce that to the Long Range Model 3, too.But frankly, I'm much more interested in the upgrades to the Model S & Model X. They just got an upgrade to the drivetrain; more efficiency, better cooling and faster charging, all while using the same battery pack. But what I'm really hoping to see soon -- I think it's overdue -- is an upgrade to the MS/X battery pack using innovations and new architecture developed for the Model 3! I also am hoping to see Tesla switch the MS/X packs over to the new 2170 cells, altho for some reason I cannot understand, Elon keeps saying that's not part of the plan. Some people commenting to IEVs News articles also claim an interior refit is in the works for the MS/MX, altho I haven't seen any word of that either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I assume it is unlimited but we all know what happens when you assume. I have also heard that insurance is outrageous, so much so that Tesla will offer their own. Is any part of that statement true?50,000 miles on the warranty. Insurance is probably about the same as a comparably priced car. It was funny.

1,"Cypry screen seemed well placed, but I think Tesla should offer classes and maybe live online webinars on how to use the UI. It seemed fairly complex, and not very intuitive. But I didn’t get much time with it.The car is much better looking in person, than in pictures.I didn’t really like not having basic mechanical latches for the trunk and hood, and glove box, and needing to use the screen. But maybe if they added a smartwatch app that allowed you to simply pass the watch near them to open? The steering wheel and AC adjustments were pretty neat, but not sure how well that would work to adjust while driving.They make great products overall, but seem to over complicate things that should be simple.Wish they would make a $20k EV, with just basic features and not a lot of unnecessary fancy tech, and unnecessarily quick acceleration. 6-7 seconds is plenty quick for a daily driver. Just give a couple basic gages for speed and kWh remaining.By 2020, I’ll see what they have to offer for the Model 3, and hopefully some options will be more alacart and not all bundled together.In the meantime, I did sign up to get notified when the Model 3 will be available for a test drive. I’m not shelling out any cash for a car I can’t test drive first.Click to expand...Horray for Model 3!The idea of giving this kind of award to any other car in 2018 is crazy!It may not be perfect, but it is an awesome car and easily the most important car of the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"(repeats column first published on thursday) by andy home london, may 24 (reuters) - niocorp developments, which is in the process of raising financing for a minerals project in nebraska, has just seen its toronto-listed shares surge from c$0.52 to $0.70 in the space of two days thanks to the u.s. government. niocorp’s planned mine and processing facility at elk creek will produce three metals - scandium, niobium and titanium - that have all been officially designated “critical” minerals by the interior department. no-one’s mined niobium in the united states since 1959, according to the united states geological survey (usgs). the country relies exclusively on imports, mostly from brazil. the same is true of scandium, a metal which, according to niocorp, has been used for several decades in “cutting-edge soviet and russian military technologies” but not by the u.s. armed forces due to a lack of supply. this is precisely the point for u.s. president donald trump’s administration, which is developing a strategy to reduce import reliance for metals considered “critical to the economic and national security of the united states.” what’s critical? the department of the interior has identified 35 minerals as “critical”. the designation is based on a matrix of criteria, including physical scarcity, concentration of production, supply chain reliability and u.s. import dependency. or, as summarized by one commerce department representative, “critical means you need it, strategic means you don’t have it.” the unnamed official, quote: d by the usgs in its explanation of the methodology behind the list, was involved with the 1978-1979 presidential review of nonfuel minerals policy. which is a reminder that this is not the first u.s. administration that has been worried about mineral import dependence. however, the list of minerals deemed “critical” has changed significantly over the intervening 40 years as manufacturing processes have advanced. consider, for example, the case of the humble computer chip. in the 1980s, according to the usgs, only 12 elements were used in its manufacture. a decade later and the number had risen to 16 and by 2006 as many as 60 elements were being used for high-speed, high-capacity integrated circuits. whole new industries have emerged over the same time frame. the lithium ion battery, which sits at the heart of the green transport revolution, was only commercialised at the start of the 1990s. no big surprise, then, to see both lithium and cobalt, two key but supply-challenged inputs into the new generation of batteries, appear on the list. so too does the rare earth elements group. none of them are domestically produced in the u.s. and most of them come from just one country, china. china is also the dominant supplier of other esoteric but “critical” components of the elemental table such as antimony, indium, tellurium and tungsten. the list includes more conventional commodities such as the platinum group metals (all of them), tin and aluminium. the usgs stresses that in such cases it’s not just the metal but the entire supply chain that is problematic. “aluminum is included to represent the aluminum supply chain because the united states is 100 percent reliant on imports of metallurgical grade bauxite, and some forms of high purity alumina and aluminum metal used for important applications also are considered critical.” the full list of critical minerals can be found here: here reducing import reliance the u.s. government is imposing tariffs on imports of aluminium with the stated aim of rekindling dormant domestic production capacity and reducing import dependency. and increasing domestic supply across the spectrum of the periodic table is going to be a core recommendation in the report being compiled by the commerce department for submission to president trump by aug. 16, 2018. commerce is also likely to recommend improved mapping of resources, streamlining lease permitting and anything else that will “increase discovery, production and domestic refining of critical minerals.” one possible outcome, welcomed by companies such as niocorp but feared by environmental groups, could be a revitalization of the u.s. mining industry. as the commerce department itself notes, “any recommendations to improve permitting processes for critical minerals will improve permitting processes for all minerals administered under the same laws and regulations by the bureau of land management and other federal land management agencies.” however, it’s going to be a slow process. niocorp, for example, is the only prospective near-term project for niobium and scandium in north america and, even with a full feasibility study already completed, the company still needs to raise around $1 billion to realise its ambitions. which is why the commerce department report will also look at other sources of supply such as recycling and cooperating with “allies and partners” to access targeted minerals. defense logistics agency the commerce department’s list of potential measures doesn’t include the creation of a national stockpile of critical minerals such as that operated in china by the state-run strategic reserves bureau. that’s because the united states already has one, operated by the defense logistics agency (dla), the body charged with managing supply chains for the country’s armed forces. as of september 2016, the most recent operational report, the dla held stocks of many of the minerals on the interior department’s list with a total value of $1.15 billion. on the current financial year’s potential shopping list are rare earths (up to a maximum 416 tonnes), battery precursors such as lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (2.16 tonnes), ferroniobium (209 tonnes) and truly esoteric goodies such as cadmium zinc tellurium and tungsten rhenium. catching up the dla is also heavily involved both in recycling materials such as germanium and studying possible alternatives to existing “critical” military inputs. but it can only be part of a broader strategy that will have to be both multidimensional and highly flexible. there is no simple solution to the fact that the united states doesn’t have any commercially exploitable bauxite deposits or that cobalt production is so concentrated on the african copperbelt. moreover, other countries, particularly china, have already aggressively built out supply chains to supply the battery-makers that will power the world’s growing electric vehicle fleet. identifying which minerals are “critical” is the easy part. working out what to do about them is going to be much harder.

1,"las vegas (reuters) - ford motor co on tuesday said it will partner with delivery service postmates inc as the automaker starts later this year testing in a u.s. city how to transport people, food and packages using its self-driving cars. ford’s plans challenge the ambitions of ride services companies like uber technologies inc [uber.ul] and highlight how automakers and those with roots in the tech industry are forging separate paths to build businesses enabled by self-driving cars. while ford has a partnership with ride-hailing company lyft, the automaker is focusing on moving goods itself for businesses large and small, jim farley, president of global markets, and sherif marakby, ford’s head of autonomous and electric vehicle development told reuters in an interview. “we’re testing the business model” for goods delivery, farley said. initially, ford plans to use vehicles with human drivers to test how to run services that would eventually use automated vehicles. ford will expand delivery partners beyond dominos pizza and san francisco-based postmates, farley said. the automaker sees small businesses as a significant potential market and a natural next step after decades of catering to commercial van and pickup buyers, he said. in an address at the ces technology conference in las vegas, farley outlined a concept for self-driving vehicles to pick up and deliver packages from multiple small businesses on a single trip. the key for making profit, farley said, is keeping the cars moving. “any time you are not carrying goods or people in this business you are not making money,” farley said. the automaker has not named the city where it will begin testing its approach. jim farley, president of global markets, ford motor company, speaks at ces in las vegas, nevada, u.s. january 9, 2018. reuters/rick wilking ford intends to power its self-driving cars with plug-in hybrid systems that rely on petroleum-fueled engines to extend range and power the electronics needed for automated driving, farley and marakby said. but top california clean air regulator mary nichols had tweeted her objection to that plan last month. “earth to ford: what part of sustainability do you not understand?” nichols had tweeted. “driverless hybrid vehicles running 24/7 delivering pizza and passengers means more tons of pollution/ghgs in cities!” marakby and farley said the power demands from computers and sensors can cut the range of an all-electric self-driving car by half. ford does not plan to use full electric systems until the second generation of its self-driving vehicles, marakby said. general motors co has trained its resources on developing self-driving, all-electric vehicles for use as taxis in big cities. gm has said it will begin launching robo-taxi services in cities by 2019. waymo, alphabet inc’s self-driving car unit, is launching its first public tests in the suburbs of phoenix. waymo is currently using hybrid minivans built by fiat chrysler automobiles nv . toyota motor corp on monday used the backdrop of the ces technology show here to outline plans to develop services for moving goods and people, and showed a prototype of a multi-purpose self-driving vehicle called e‐palette that it intends to begin testing in the early 2020s. ford has said it will launch its own self-driving vehicles by 2021. reporting by joseph white; editing by meredith mazzilli",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"(adds musk's tweet, broker notes, updates shares) april 2 (reuters) - shares of tesla inc fell almost 5 percent on monday ahead of the electric car maker's announcement of quarterly production numbers for its crucial model 3 sedan. shares in elon musk's $50-billion dollar venture have been reeling from a triple whammy of probes into a fatal crash in california, concerns about model 3 production and nerves over its debt load after a credit downgrade by rating agency moody's. tesla has committed to build 2,500 model 3s per week by the end of the quarter as a reassurance to the market that it can meet targets, which it has consistently missed. three wall street analysts said the company was likely to fall short of its own estimates again, but might satisfy wall street's reduced expectations. the numbers are due sometime this week. ""we like the set-up headed into q1 deliveries as we believe sentiment is overly negative, and think tesla may be able to exceed lower expectations,"" baird analyst ben kallo wrote in a note. shares of the company were last down 4.4 percent at $254 in heavy trading, bringing its losses this year to nearly 15 percent. failure to meet its production targets and liquidity pressures also prompted the moody's downgrade last week. the ratings agency said tesla was likely to raise more than $2 billion in new capital, partly to cover about $1.2 billion in convertible bonds coming due by march 2019. ""we consider a small possibility of tesla releasing supportive data this week but mainly high probability that management and the board will take more drastic action on guidance and funding to restore credibility,"" jefferies analyst philippe houchois wrote in a client note.

0,"tesla has lost another key executive: jim keller, the chip-design superstar who was in charge of developing the electric car company’s in-house artificial intelligence processor. keller is a veteran of amd (amd) and apple (aapl) , having designed the hit athlon and ryzen processors for the former and the a4 and a5 chipsets for the latter. multiple reports state he’s heading to amd nemesis intel (intc) , where he will work alongside another former amd exec, raja koduri. this is not good news for elon musk, who was just months ago proclaiming that, “jim is developing specialized ai hardware that we think will be the best in the world.” keller is the latest in a string of tesla executives to leave the troubled company. in march, vice president of finance susan repo and chief accounting officer eric branderiz both departed. the month before, it was global sales and service chief jon mcneill, who became lyft’s chief operating officer. tesla (tsla) is having issues with making its model 3 sedan—earlier this month it paused production for the second time , apparently because of an over-reliance on robots. “excessive automation at tesla was a mistake…humans are underrated,” musk tweeted at the time. but automation of the driving experience is key to tesla’s vision, and the department is having trouble hanging onto its leaders. when keller joined the company in 2016, he replaced another former apple employee—chris lattner—who lasted all of six months. (lattner’s predecessor, sterling anderson, got into a legal spat with the company after he left to form his own self-driving car startup, aurora innovation. they settled a year ago.) intel, now with keller and koduri on board, has already been making great strides in the self-driving-car chip space. so who’s keller’s replacement in charge of tesla’s autopilot hardware? pete bannon, who like keller worked for apple after the iphone giant bought chipmaker pa semi. again like keller, bannon has been at tesla for a couple years. a tesla spokesperson told elektrek, which first reported keller’s departure , that bannon would take over autopilot and “andrej karpathy, tesla’s director of ai and autopilot vision, will now have overall responsibility for all autopilot software.” bannon and karpathy have great credentials, which is good as they really have their work cut out for them. tesla’s autopilot program is under close scrutiny after a model x driver crashed and died last month near san francisco—the company claimed the driver was at fault, as he engaged autopilot despite knowing it was “not perfect.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,"one of president donald trump’s main gripes about china’s trade conditions has been about cars— he doesn’t like the fact that china levies a 25% tariff on imported american cars, while chinese-made cars only attract a 2.5% tariff when they enter the u.s. now, china’s government has made an auto-related announcement that might go some way toward pleasing the u.s. president: china is going to allow full foreign ownership of automakers on its turf, within five years. at the moment, overseas carmakers that want into the chinese market have to either import their wares or form 50-50 joint ventures with local, state-owned partners. the latter option avoids those big tariffs, but it means giving those local partners access to the intellectual property needed to make the cars. companies such as volkswagen (vlkay) and general motors (gm) abide by these rules in order to tap the chinese market. tesla (tsla) seems likely to benefit from the new move, as it has shunned the joint venture option —its insistence on going it alone in china, with a production facility in the shanghai free trade zone, seemed certain to earn it that 25% price bump, but no longer. according to the associated press , the chinese authorities will start by eliminating limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. in 2020, the same limits will be removed for makers of commercial vehicles, and passenger vehicles will follow a couple years later. the move suggests particular confidence in china’s electric car industry. the country said last year that it was moving towards complete electrification of its automobiles, and would be phasing out the production and sale of cars that run on fossil fuels. some have suggested that china’s electrification push, combined with its insistence on joint ventures, have given the country’s electric vehicle industry an unfair advantage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0,"talk about making a splash. genesis, the luxury brand started by hyundai just over two years ago, is the highest-rated brand in consumer reports' 2018 ranking of auto brands. this is the first year genesis is eligible to be ranked by consumer reports. ""genesis has luxury cars that not only have good reliability, but they are also comfortable and the technology in them is easy to use,"" said jake fisher, director of automotive testing at consumer reports. ""a lot of luxury cars have technology and features that are too complex, too cumbersome or even distracting. that's not the case with genesis."" consumer reports has included genesis for the first time in the auto rankings because the brand now has at least two models, which is a prerequisite for the annual rating. the report card is based on a number of factors including crash tests, consumer reports' own testing and analysis of vehicles, and a survey of more than a half million consumer reports subscribers who detail what doesn't work on the cars and trucks they drive. this year, the top three brands are genesis, followed by audi and bmw . tesla , was ranked no. 8 out of 34 brands. that is the exact same spot where the electric-car maker was ranked in last year's report.

0,"Hi everyone, another happy Tesla 3 owner here.While I still have got stock floor mats in my Tesla, I am looking at different options that may work well for the wet and dirty weather. First I started looking at WEathertech. I know they are not cheap, but I had them in my previous sedan (Honda Accord) and I still have them in my other Truck (Chevy Silverado). I looked at the mats that I've got in my Checy and realized that even if I go with Tan WeatherTechs, they will just not look right in the Model 3 due to their design. I believe they will fit and keep moisture inside, but I don't think that's the look one should get if they get a Tesla.Anyways, I saw 3d maxpider mats online, they look nice in the pic, not that rugged, but I am concerned about 2 things, that's why decided to post here and ask your folks opinion. 1. This brand seems to be not too popular, or I am doing bad at my Google search. 2. I will have to wait when I order them. That's okay, unless I will really get a good product. And of course, I expect to get something, not just pay and keep getting run-around...I was looking at rubber mats, KAGU 3d mats. DO they fit well? How's the quality? If you ordered and had to wait, how long did it take the mats to arrive?Any comments are appreciated as I have to make a decision and finally order something!Regards,Shawn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"(adds tesla's response, details on model 3 registrations) san francisco, may 23 (reuters) - two u.s. consumer advocacy groups urged the federal trade commission on wednesday to investigate what they called tesla inc's ""deceptive and misleading"" use of the name autopilot for its assisted-driving technology. the center for auto safety and consumer watchdog, both non-profit groups, sent a letter to the ftc saying that consumers could be misled into thinking, based on tesla's marketing and advertising, that autopilot makes a tesla vehicle self-driving. autopilot, released in 2015, is an enhanced cruise-control system that partially automates steering and braking. tesla states in its owner's manual and in disclaimers that when the system is engaged, a driver must keep hands on the wheel at all times while using autopilot. ""the feedback that we get from our customers shows that they have a very clear understanding of what autopilot is, how to properly use it, and what features it consists of,"" a tesla spokesperson said. but in the letter, the groups said that a series of ads and press releases from tesla as well as statements by the company's chief executive, elon musk, ""mislead and deceive customers into believing that autopilot is safer and more capable than it is known to be."" ""tesla is the only automaker to market its level 2 vehicles as 'self-driving', and the name of its driver assistance suite of features, autopilot, connotes full autonomy,"" the letter read. ""the burden now falls on the ftc to investigate tesla's unfair and deceptive practices so that consumers have accurate information, understand the limitations of autopilot, and conduct themselves appropriately and safely,"" it read. tesla has also faced criticism from an influential magazine, consumer reports, over braking flaws in its model 3 sedan, which is seen as key to the company's profitability. musk has promised a quick fix. meanwhile, the popularity of the model 3 has led to more registrations in california for the first quarter than class rivals bmw 3-series and mercedes c-class, according to the california new car dealers association (cncda). california is a key market for global luxury vehicle brands not just because of its size, but because other markets often follow trends set by wealthy consumers in the state. several crashes and fire incidents involving a tesla car this year has been a constant headache for musk, who boasts that his company's cars are among the safest in the industry. two u.s. tesla drivers have died in crashes in which autopilot was engaged. the most recent crash, in march, is being investigated by safety regulators. tesla has said the use of autopilot results in 40 percent fewer crashes, a claim the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration repeated in a 2017 report on the first fatality, which occurred in may 2016. earlier this month, however, the agency said regulators had not assessed the effectiveness of the technology. last month, another group, consumers union, the advocacy division of consumer reports, called on tesla to improve the safety of its autopilot system. shares of tesla rose 0.5 percent to $276.40 on wednesday.

0,"april 27 (reuters) - carmakers have big plans for their next generation of factories: smarter designs, artificial intelligence and collaborative robots building a wide range of vehicles on the same line. the plants will also feature a component they say is the secret ingredient to flexible manufacturing: humans. saic-gm’s factory in shanghai, which opened in 2016, is one of the world’s most advanced auto plants, assembling buick minivans and cadillac sedans and suvs, including the ct-6 plug-in hybrid for u.s. consumers. gm’s shanghai plant is expected to eventually produce new electric vehicles, primarily for the chinese market, executives have said. the plant, which gm operates with chinese partner saic motor corp ltd, feels almost like a scene from a star wars film, with battalions of machines quietly working in self-directed harmony. collaborative robots, or “cobots,” painted matte green and unrestrained by the steel cages that surround their larger industrial cousins, are being programmed to work alongside humans on the line. one unusual operation advanced models now handle is installing gears in transmissions. “they can actually feel; they can pick up a gear set (and) mesh the gear into a transmission,” paul buetow, gm’s china manufacturing chief, said on a recent tour of the plant. the robots reduce strain on humans and improve quality and consistency. globally, automakers are embracing industry 4.0 — a term coined by german manufacturers for the digitalisation and automation of assembly processes — and the consensus is that fewer people will be required in future factories. but humans will still be needed. “this is not about cutting head count,” said an insider familiar with industry efforts to upgrade and streamline auto plants in the united states, china and europe. the focus instead is on improving flexibility and efficiency between machines and humans as automakers figure out how to build multiple models — powered by gas engines, electric motors, or both — in the same factory. “it’s not just blood and sweat that goes into manufacturing on an assembly line,” said united auto workers president dennis williams. “it’s critical thinking that automation can’t replicate.” doing the dirty work a new generation of cobots is working alongside humans at general motors co plants from shanghai to orion township, michigan. the orion plant, north of detroit, is one of the industry’s most flexible. it builds three models on one line: the gas-engine chevrolet sonic, the battery-powered chevrolet bolt ev and the self-driving cruise av. more than 800 robots work there, including a half-dozen cobots painted green to denote they can safely operate around humans. the machines handle the “dirty, dull, difficult and dangerous” tasks while people do the work requiring dexterity and intelligence, says marty linn, gm’s principal engineer for robotics. in one section of the plant, cobots glue protective pads onto headliners, a tough job for humans because the glue is heated to scalding temperatures before it is applied. at another station, a cobot takes new spare tires off a conveyor belt and stacks them on a cart. this, gm’s linn said, was a job workers universally hated because it was repetitive and back-breaking. at the end of the line, cobots ensure headlamps are properly aligned. they will also be used to test sensors on automated vehicles, linn said. markus schaefer, head of production and supply chain at daimler ag’s mercedes-benz cars, said the german automaker is “paring back automation” in final assembly to boost flexibility. “we need this because we are making a greater variety of derivatives and, as a premium automaker, we make highly individualized vehicles,” he said. schaefer said mercedes will eventually have plants that can build vehicles with different powertrains and with both front- and rear-wheel drive. the automaker is converting its showcase sindelfingen plant to build the gla, a compact front-wheel-drive utility vehicle, as well as its rear-wheel-drive s-class luxury sedan. shaping the future how collaborative robots and other digital tools are used will determine the size and layout of future factories - and how many humans work there. ford motor co executive joe hinrichs created a stir last october when detailing the automaker’s vision of a future factory for electric vehicles, which have fewer parts than those with combustion engines and thus would require far less floor space, fewer workers and lower investment. but like other major global carmakers, ford appears reluctant to invest in dedicated electric-vehicle plants until there is sufficient - and consistent - demand to justify the expense. ford has years of experience building different types of vehicles on one line, including versions of the focus compact with gasoline engines and electric motors. ford has installed a few collaborative robots at its recently renovated louisville, kentucky, truck plant. the company is also using digital tools such as including augmented reality to map new assembly lines, and predictive analytics to schedule repairs and maintenance before machines break down. the company has no immediate plans for a separate, highly automated plant for its next-generation electric vehicles, some of which are expected to share factory space with traditional combustion-engine models, according to sources familiar with ford’s strategy. an april report by barclays’ global auto investment team predicted “robots won’t kill all automotive jobs,” at least not in the near term. auto companies are working on “perfecting the combination of human and robot,” according to the report, because “the human touch is still necessary.” even tesla chief executive elon musk, who long praised robots’ virtues and promised to turn his california electric car factory into a highly automated “alien dreadnought,” has had something of an epiphany. bedeviled by technical glitches, musk recently tweeted: “excessive automation at tesla was a mistake ... humans are underrated.” (edward taylor reported from frankfurt, germany, norihiko shirouzu reported from shanghai and nick carey reported from detroit; written by paul lienert; edited by gerry doyle)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on history, I do think it's going to take more than a month to build up to doing 5000 per week as an average for an entire month, or rather a four-week period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(for a graphic of neodymium prices click reut.rs/2dlohte ) china, which resumed neodymium exports in 2015, imposed strict export quotas across a range of rare earth metal in 2010, saying it wanted to curtail pollution and preserve resources. costly process “people seem to have forgotten china’s export ban. it could happen again. china is really the main producer, no one else has invested as much in rare earths,” a rare earth trader said. despite their name, rare earths are found in many places around the world, but the process of extraction is difficult and expensive, as it requires separating multiple different metals from a single deposit. this is unlike the much simpler process, for example, of recovering copper from ore.(for a graphic of rare earth producers click reut.rs/2fu5hne ) china has invested heavily in the rare earth metals process but its crackdown on mining, smelting and other polluting industries is forecast to slow supply. it already helped push the neodymium price to a two-year high of $96 in september. “rare earth production is as bad as you can get in terms of environmental damage,” the trader said. “china used its dominant position before, what’s to stop it doing so again?” such supply concerns are encouraging automakers to search for ways of cutting down neodymium use. toyota motor corp ( 7203.t ) said last month it had found a way to cut use of the metal in electric motors by about a fifth. the japanese firm said it had developed a magnet which replaced some of the neodymium with more abundant and cheaper rare earths — lanthanum and cerium. toyota aims to use the magnets in electric vehicle motors within the next 10 years. other manufacturers of electric vehicles that use permanent magnets include bmw bmwg, nissan ( 7201.t ) and geely ( 0175.hk ). several companies produce rare earth metals outside china, including london-listed rainbow rare earths ( rbwr.l ), canada-listed namibia rare earths ( nre.v ) and australia’s spectrum rare earths ( spx.ax ). but, for now, auto makers making permanent magnet motors remain heavily reliant on china, which according to roskill accounted for 85 percent of global output of rare earth oxide estimated at 161,700 tonnes in 2017. morgan stanley analysts estimate electric vehicles will total 50,000 units in 2020 or 2.3 percent of the total, rising to 400,000 in 2025 or 17.4 percent, and 975,000 in 2030 or 40.9 percent. reporting by pratima desai; editing by veronica brown and edmund blair",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0,"toronto (reuters) - rnc minerals is in talks with commodity traders, mine operators and financiers to help secure $1 billion to build the world’s biggest nickel and cobalt project next year, the canadian miner said. a global battery boom, driven by growing demand for electric cars, is pushing prices higher for such key ingredients as nickel and cobalt and encouraging miners to accelerate development plans. conditions are right to build dumont in the canadian province of quebec, said rnc. with 3.15 million tonnes of nickel sulfide and 126,000 tonnes of cobalt, it is the largest undeveloped reserve of both metals in the world, the toronto-based company said on monday, citing s&p global market intelligence data. rnc, which changed its name from royal nickel in 2016, is in talks with large japanese trading houses, companies that offer “streaming” deals and miners interested in off-take arrangements to feed their smelters, said chief executive mark selby in an interview. streaming deals offer miners upfront cash in exchange for future production at a discounted, fixed price. “we have a clear path to secure financial backing,” said selby. lithium batteries, which contain cobalt and high-grade nickel, power electric vehicles for automakers ranging from tesla to general motors. ubs estimates 15 million electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, lifting nickel demand by 300,000-900,000 tonnes, or by some 10-40 percent of the current market. analysts at cru group forecast the battery sector will need more than 75,000 tonnes of cobalt a year by 2025, up from around 41,000 tonnes in 2016. in the past six months, nickel prices have climbed 38 percent and cobalt 27 percent. rnc is not yet in direct talks with battery makers or car companies, but is open to those discussions, selby said. the company is also seeking debt financing to fund half the development cost, he said, and expects to complete financing deals late this year and start the two-year construction project in 2019. rnc owns 50-percent of dumont with private equity firm waterton global resource management holding the remainder. cobalt is mainly mined in the war-torn democratic republic of congo. the market is dominated by glencore, which produced more than 28,000 tonnes in 2016 and agreed to sell up to 20,000 tonnes of cobalt to a chinese battery maker. analysts at macquarie research expect cobalt deficits of 885 tonnes this year, 3,205 in 2019 and 5,340 in 2020. bmo forecasts a 36,000-tonne nickel deficit in 2018 and sees demand for nickel used in electric car batteries to grow by 215,000 tonnes by 2025, about 10 percent of the current market size. reporting by susan taylor; editing by nick zieminski",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
