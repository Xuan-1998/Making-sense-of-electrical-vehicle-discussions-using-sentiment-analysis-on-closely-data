0,"san francisco, feb 16 (reuters) - some potential buyers of tesla’s long-delayed model 3 sedan are concerned that they will miss out on big federal tax breaks and are looking for alternatives, including general motors co’s chevrolet bolt, according to postings by would-be tesla buyers on websites and interviews with gm dealers. last week tesla told some holders of model 3 reservations that they would not get their cars until 2019, eliciting howls of complaint on tesla online fan forums. tesla declined to comment. gm dealers in california, the top u.s. market for electric vehicles, say brisk demand for bolts is driven in part by frustrated tesla buyers who are afraid they will lose a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit if they wait. the tax credit drops in value and eventually disappears once tesla sells 200,000 electric vehicles in the united states, which edmunds analyst jeremy acevedo expects tesla to hit by the fall. tesla’s model 3 production troubles give rival auto makers a chance to snatch customers. tesla has said that the net number of refundable $1,000 reservations for model 3s was stable late last year and grew in recent weeks, with hundreds of thousands in line. but some buyers are running out of time or patience. chevrolet dealer yev kaplinskiy said his dealership located between san francisco and silicon valley sold 15 bolts last weekend, after tesla’s latest delay. “we’re getting the tesla people who wanted their model 3,” kaplinskiy said. “we ask them, ‘what other cars are you interested in?’ they’re mostly tesla. but they want the car now. they don’t want to wait.” some of the weekend buyers had turned to chevy because of the most recent tesla delay, he said. chevrolet sent an email to some prospective buyers this week, announcing in bold case, “bolt ev: now available.” the bolt and model 3 both start at about $35,000 and can travel more than 200 miles (322 km) on an electric charge, although the tesla and its chief executive elon musk have received much more media attention. while tesla is struggling with production of the model 3, gm sold 23,297 bolts in 2017, with monthly sales mostly rising. kelley blue book reported that bolts are in relatively short supply as measured by days in inventory, which fell to 42 in january from a high of 65 in august. by comparison, the nissan motor co ltd leaf, an electric car with shorter range, was in inventory for 202 days. for a graphic on 2017 bolt sales, click here: reut.rs/2sxevt9 last wednesday, some of those who made early reservations for the base version model 3 received emails from tesla saying their vehicles would not be delivered until early 2019, delayed from 2018. “i‘m feeling extremely fleeced by elon - guy secured an interest free loan from me (reservation payment) for a car i hadn’t seen before reserving, and just told me that it might be another year before i should receive it,” wrote one person from seattle, “206er”, who was among a handful on teslamotorsclub.com saying they were cancelling reservations after the new delay. reuters was unable to contact the posters or confirm that they were cancelling reservations. “my objective...was always a $35,000 tesla for the price of a decently optioned civic (with full federal tax credit),” 206er added. tesla is closing in on 200,000 u.s. electric vehicle sales thanks to the popularity of its luxury model s sedan and model x suv. if it hits 200,000 u.s. electric vehicle sales in the third quarter, then the $7,500 tax credit would phase out in stages over 2019. gm also is getting close to the limit, having sold nearly 170,000 plug-in cars, including bolts, volts and others, through the end of last year, green car reports estimated. sonoma chevrolet general manager ken scholl, said the subsidy had been a key draw for bolts and a concern for those who had given up on a tesla. “if i had 50 (bolts) in december, we would have sold every one,” he said. additional reporting by joe white; editing by peter henderson and lisa shumaker"
1,"in the skies above hullavington airfield in south-west england, there was a time when trainee parachutists would leap out of aircraft into the void, trusting in the kit strapped to their backs to save them from falling to earth. the former raf base's current inhabitant, dyson, is embarking on its own adventure fraught with peril: a £2bn project to develop and build electric cars from scratch. the uk company is betting on its ingenuity, engineering skills and technology to save it from falling to earth in its audacious attempt to break into the global automotive industry. ""a car's a huge challenge,"" founder james dyson told the financial times at the company's nearby malmesbury headquarters. the £2bn gamble is the appliance maker's boldest move yet; one that will either grow to define the brand as it dwarfs its other products that range from vacuum cleaners to hair dryers, or drain its resources and potentially plunge it into oblivion. through interviews with more than 20 people, the ft has gleaned details about the project's scope and current status, including learning that dyson is considering excluding its world-leading ""solid state"" battery technology from its debut model. dyson declined to confirm many of the details in this report. the company is initially planning a range of three vehicles, according to two people. the first car will be used to establish a route to market, a supply chain and a potential customer base. because of this, the vehicle will have a relatively low production run — in the single-digit thousands, three people said. the second and third vehicles, released later, will aim to be substantially higher volume. ""even with a low-volume vehicle, they can make a business case and they will learn a tremendous amount about how to build a vehicle,"" says philippe houchois, an automotive analyst at jefferies investment bank. dyson has worked extensively on lightweight materials, leading several people to speculate the first vehicle may be substantially comprised of plastics rather than metals, something usually reserved for high-end supercars. this would make the cars lighter — important because of the weight of electric batteries — but also allowing for more inventive designs. when announcing the project last september, sir james said the first car would look ""quite different"" to any currently on the market. crucially, dyson is considering using lithium ion batteries rather than solid state in the first car, according to three people. although the company has not confirmed a decision, a choice not to use solid state would indicate a scaling back in the technical ambitions for its first vehicle. the aim is to use solid state in the two future models, one person with sight of the plans said. solid state batteries, which dyson has been developing for years, are a step change beyond lithium ion technology, with the ability to drive further and charge faster. sylvain gaboury | filmmagic | getty images sir james dyson with one of his dyson inventions. while many major car manufacturers are developing the technology, only toyota has laid out a timeline to release a solid state car before 2025. that means dyson has the potential to be first to market with a technology widely hailed as the future of electric cars. but ditching solid state in the first model would give dyson a better chance of hitting its target of getting the vehicle to market by 2021, says mr houchois at jefferies. ""they want to control the variables. what they don't want to be is a tesla that over-promises and then delivers two to three years late."" sir james told the ft the company has been ""investing heavily in new battery technology, solid state battery technology . . . but those sorts of technologies can take some time to get there."" but the entrepreneur declined to give specific details of its battery plans, or confirm ft reports about the decision. ""we're not talking about what we're doing,"" he says. the company has pledged to invest £1bn into its battery development, and another £1bn into the car venture itself. sir james remains confident it will hit its target of releasing a car in 2020 or 2021. yet the timeline is extremely ambitious, especially since the key decision over a manufacturing site has yet to be made. the uk remains in serious contention for a manufacturing location, sir james insists, along with singapore, malaysia and china. it is thought two uk sites are being considered, one in wales and one in wiltshire, according to discussions with local agencies and people familiar with dyson's plans. however, several factors point against deciding to locate in britain. despite asking for financial support from the uk government, conversations with officials have failed to yield more funding on top of a £16m grant dyson received for its battery development. sir james expects china to be the company's largest market for its cars — something that would by implication favour one of the far eastern nations where dyson currently has manufacturing operations, such as singapore or malaysia. the availability of local skills in electronics and battery technology are also a major factor, he said. ""you've got to do it where it's commercially the best place to do it,"" he says, adding the final manufacturing decision will be taken before the summer. singapore, where dyson has manufacturing capacity, is thought to be favoured by the business, according to multiple people. the group has also been heavily recruiting potential sales staff in china, according to two people in the country. read more from financial times: dyson should never say never in quest for electric dream  musk's mega-bucks don't require mega profits  musk reaches for the stars but investors grow impatient  but with that crucial piece in the puzzle still missing, some in the industry doubt whether the company can have its cars, and its suppliers, ready in time. ""whether you're a dyson or a toyota it takes 18 months to tool for headlights,"" says one person who has worked with dyson on its project, while selecting suppliers can also take up to two years. dyson aims to lean less heavily on suppliers than traditional carmakers, partly because of a penchant for making components in house, and partly because electric cars contain substantially fewer bits than their combustion engine counterparts. the group already produces electric motors, which turn the wheels, as well as battery cells in-house, and is investing heavily in software development, an increasingly important part of modern cars. in the past six months, dyson has held extensive talks with some of the industry's largest suppliers. in some of the meetings the company was vague or unclear about what it was specifically after, according to several people who took part in discussions. ""they have tended to keep all the of the right people in house,"" says one person who has advised the group. ""but that approach doesn't work in autos, where more of the work is outsourced."" even so, as a maker of domestic appliances, dyson does have long experience of running a global supply chain and manufacturing operations — something that has caused significant problems for fresh industry entrants such as tesla. ""he's not a silicon valley start-up, he understands manufacturing,"" says one long-time supplier to the company. current suppliers, while fiercely loyal, also warn against underestimating the company. ""i get the feeling that he's much more advanced than we're led to believe,"" says one supplier, who has been involved in the automotive project. ""he's either completely misaligned himself, or he's better organised than anyone in the market expects."""

0,"(adds police statement) washington, may 16 (reuters) - the u.s. national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) said on wednesday that it was sending a team to investigate the crash of a tesla inc vehicle last week in utah that occurred while the car was in autopilot mode. it is at least the second tesla crash linked to the semi-autonomous autopilot system being investigated by the government agency since january. police in utah said a tesla report of the vehicle showed that the driver of the model s enabled autopilot about 1 minute and 22 seconds before the crash. the report said she took her hands off the steering wheel ""within two seconds"" of engaging the system and then did not touch the steering wheel for the next 80 seconds, until the crash happened. the police said in a statement that the driver, a 28-year-old woman, ""admitted that she was looking at her phone prior to the collision."" tesla advises drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using autopilot, which the company says does not make the vehicle autonomous. the nhtsa said it ""launched its special crash investigations team to gather information on the south jordan, utah, crash,"" and said it ""will take appropriate action based on its review."" tesla did not immediately comment. the police said the tesla model s during that day's trip registered more than a dozen instances of the driver's hands being off the steering wheel. on two such occasions, the driver had her hands off the wheel for more than one minute each time and her hands came back on only after a visual alert, the tesla report said. the driver was traveling at 60 miles (97 km) per hour when the model s smashed into a fire truck stopped at a red light about 20 miles south of salt lake city on friday night, according to police. the tesla driver suffered a broken ankle. police issued the driver a traffic citation for failure to keep proper lookout. nhtsa is also investigating a fatal crash in march that involved a tesla model x using autopilot. it is also probing the january crash of a tesla vehicle apparently traveling in autopilot that struck a fire truck. both incidents were in california. last week, nhtsa also said it would probe a may 8 tesla accident in florida that killed two teenagers and injured another. autopilot was not thought to play a part. nhtsa can order a recall if it finds a defect poses an unreasonable risk to safety. the national transportation safety board, a separate government agency that looks into accidents and makes safety recommendations, has said it is not investigating the utah crash. the ntsb is investigating the other three tesla incidents being looked at by nhtsa, as well as an august 2017 tesla battery fire in california, in which an owner ran the vehicle into his garage. swiss prosecutors said this week that they were looking into the fatal crash of a tesla in southern switzerland.

0,"46 pm / updated 15 minutes ago daimler warns of supply chain risk from switch to electric cars reuters staff 4 min read frankfurt (reuters) - daimler ag ( daign.de ), owner of the mercedes-benz brand, warned that a fall in demand for diesel cars and a switch to electric vehicles could force it to prop up its supplier base. carmakers face increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over pollution levels produced by their diesel-engined vehicles after volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) in 2015 admitted to cheating emission tests using engine management software. to avoid a total ban on their diesel vehicles, daimler and other carmakers have stepped up development of electric cars and agreed to update their engine management software to cut down pollution levels. daimler’s suppliers are being forced to invest to help electrify the entire mercedes-benz range by 2022, prompting the carmaker to use unusually frank language to warn about the impact of the shift to electrified cars in its report. “due to the planned electrification of new model series and a shift in customer demand from diesel to gasoline engines, the mercedes-benz cars segment in particular is faced with the risk that daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers,” the carmaker said in its annual report. “this could result in over- or under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers. if suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,” daimler said. “necessary capacity expansion at suppliers’ plants could also require cost-effective participation,” daimler added. daimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing daimler to step in. daimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. in its annual report, daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices. “generally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,” the annual report said. daimler’s report, published on tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros (12.46 billion pounds) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier. the stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings. daimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined mercedes-benz vehicles in the united states in a class-action suit which alleges the german carmaker used software to reduce emissions. daimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed. among the legal risks faced by daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities. daimler also said in its report that chief executive dieter zetsche’s total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier. reporting by edward taylor; editing by keith weir"
1,"bmw and daimler are merging their untraditional operations—everything from car-sharing and ride-hailing to parking locator services and electric vehicle charging—into a single joint business as the two rival automakers attempt to better compete with uber, lyft, and other mobility companies. the two companies on wednesday signed an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture that will include five verticals: car-sharing, ride-hailing, parking, electric vehicle charging, and what they describe as “multimodal,” a term meant to cover the on-demand ordering and payment component of the business. bmw and daimler ag, the owner of mercedes-benz, said they will continue to compete in their core business of building and selling vehicles. “people will look back on today as a historic moment for the mobility of the future,” bmw group board member peter schwarzenbauer said during a roundtable discussion with reporters at the new york international auto show. “two of the major players in the automotive industry are basically joining forces in building a new company, which will in my eyes, offer a level of service that is unheard of yet.” the idea is to create a single digital ecosystem that customers can use to hail a taxi, rent a car for short stints, or find and pay for parking. the two companies will not merge their respective autonomous vehicle development programs. “the target isn’t to do a little bit here and a little bit there,” schwarzenbauer said. “we want to become the leading provider when it comes to mobility services.” but before that can happen, the two companies will have to go through the complicated process of merging their operations and determine whether to rebrand existing businesses such as daimler’s car2go and bmw’s drivenow and reachnow car-sharing units or to leave those names intact. the deal also has to be reviewed and approved by antitrust regulators. the number of businesses currently operating under each company illustrate the complexity of this new enterprise, and hint at how long it might take bmw and daimler to integrate them. for example, bmw’s drivenow and daimler’s car2go have 20,000 vehicles spread out among 31 cities globally. other bmw or daimler-owned mobility operations include moovel, reachnow, ride-hailing services such as mytaxi, chauffeur privé, clever taxi and beat, and parking businesses parknow and parkmobile. some 13 million customers and 140,000 drivers are already using bmw’s and daimler’s ride-hailing services. bmw and daimler are also projecting that the deal will increase profits. if the merger is approved, daimler expects earnings before taxes for its financial services unit will be “significantly higher than the previous year.” bmw said the joint venture will trigger a one-time valuation and earnings effect in its group financial statement. pre-tax earnings would increase slightly in 2018 compared with the previous year, bmw said. the companies have gone into business together before. in 2015, a coalition of german carmakers that included daimler, audi, and bmw agreed to acquire nokia’s here and its mapping technology."

0,"london (reuters) - when electric carmaker tesla inc. launched its first mass market model last summer, it sent a shockwave through the aluminum industry by largely shifting to steel and away from the lighter weight metal it had used in its first two luxury models. file photo: a tesla model 3 is seen in a showroom in los angeles, california, u.s. january 12, 2018. reuters/lucy nicholson/file photo the switch by elon musk’s tesla to the heavier-but-cheaper metal highlights how steel is fighting back against aluminum, which had widely been expected to be the bigger beneficiary of the electric vehicle revolution. aluminum had been seen as the key to offsetting the weight of batteries in order to extend the range of electric vehicles, crucial to increased consumer acceptance. but as makers of battery-powered cars look to tap into bigger markets with cheaper vehicles - and embrace technological developments in batteries and components - many are increasingly looking to steel to cut costs. the price of tesla’s mass-market orientated model 3 is around half of the £70,000 luxury model s. “before the aim was ‘let’s get the [electric vehicles] developed’, now it’s ‘let’s get them developed at the right price point,’” says mauro erriquez, a partner at mckinsey & company in germany who specializes in the auto sector. it is the latest tussle in a decades-long battle between steel and aluminum for market share among automakers, seeking to cut the weight of vehicles to help slash emissions and meet tough government pollution standards. steel is also winning back some market share among gasoline vehicles, such as the audi a8. the latest model abandoned its heavy use of aluminum and shifted to a mix of steel, aluminum, magnesium and carbon fiber. the competition between the metals has intensified amid rapidly growing demand for battery-powered cars. sales of electric and hybrid vehicles are due to surge to 30 percent of the global auto market by 2030, according to metal consultants cru, up from 4 percent of the 86 million vehicles sold last year. in china, the world’s largest auto market, sales of new energy vehicles are due to grow by 40 percent this year to top 1 million vehicles, according to the china association of automobile manufacturers. tesla declined to comment, but in a filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission last month it said it designed the model 3 “with a mix of materials to be lightweight and safe while also increasing cost-effectiveness for this mass-market vehicle”. other makers of mass market electric vehicles that have also chosen steel over aluminum include nissan motor co ltd’s ( 7201.t ) leaf, the world’s best-selling all-electric vehicle, and volkswagen’s ( vowg_p.de ) e-golf. the e-golf has 129 kg of aluminum and the leaf uses 171 kg while tesla’s luxury model s contains 661 kg of the metal, according to a2mac1 automotive benchmarking. a detailed breakdown was not available for the tesla 3. (for a graphic of metals used in vehicles click tmsnrt.rs/2g9ouvq ) step change aluminum is still expected to benefit greatly from the electric vehicle revolution, however, especially from hybrids because they have two engines. both the combustion engine block and transmission are typically made of aluminum while the metal is also often used for housing the battery and motor in electric vehicles, according to auto metals specialist alumag in germany. and, because it is expected to be years before pure electric vehicles become widely used - in part due to the lack of power charging networks - the growth of hybrids in the interim is expected to benefit aluminum. according to cru consultant eoin dinsmore, demand for aluminum from electric and hybrid vehicles is forecast to increase ten times to nearly 10 million tonnes by 2030. aluminum was used in the first electric london black cab, which launched last year, spurring the reopening of a uk aluminum plant in wales owned by norway’s aluminum producer norsk hydro nyh.ol. slideshow (9 images) “we chose aluminum as a material as it is nearly three times lighter than steel in its raw form, and it absorbs twice as much energy in a crash,” said chris staunton, chief engineer of body structures for the firm that developed the taxi for the london electric vehicle company ( 0175.hk ). both staunton’s firm and the london electric vehicle company are owned by china’s geely automotive holdings ltd 0175.hk>. (graphic: aluminum content climbs in vehicles - reut.rs/2fihfll ) better batteries but aluminum remains more expensive than steel. benchmark aluminum futures cmal3 on the london metal exchange are around $2,050 per ton, more than three times the cost of lme steel rebar srrc1 at $585 a ton. the price gap between the types of aluminum and steel used in autos was not as wide, but still represented significant savings by using steel, industry experts said. meanwhile, stronger and cheaper batteries for electric vehicles as well as developments in the components that generate power and overall structural design have lessened the need for aluminum to cut weight to extend the range. since 2010, the cost of batteries have tumbled to as low as $114 per kilowatt hour from $1,000/kwh and are expected to drop further in coming years, according to alumag. “i think car makers are finding that as battery costs fall they can achieve their range requirement with an all-steel solution,” said george coates, technical director for worldautosteel, the automotive arm of the world steel association. improvements in the powertrain - the main components in a car that generate power - have also had a big impact. the 2017 model of the nissan leaf extended its range by nearly 50 percent to 172 km compared to the 2011 version mainly by improving the powertrain, consolidating four separate systems into one, said mckinsey’s erriquez. (for a graphic on aluminum vs steel prices click reut.rs/2is9obr ) material mix at the same time, the steel industry has developed advanced high strength steel products, which are stronger and lighter than normal steel, and importantly, cheaper than aluminum. “(steel) companies like thyssenkrupp ( tkag.de ) and arcelormittal ( mt.as ), they’re not going to just give up this market share. there will be a battle for the material,” said jost gaertner, partner at alumag. future models will likely contain a complex mix of materials, including various grades of steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, magnesium and plastics, automakers and consultants said. bmw, which used large amounts of costly aluminum and carbon fiber in its i3 and i8, told reuters it was not planning to increase the use of those materials in future electric models. “there is no ‘one material fits all’ solution” for future electric vehicles, the german carmaker said in an email. “we will continue to employ each material in a way and in a quantity which brings in its specific advantages.” reporting by eric onstad; editing by veronica brown and cassell bryan-low"

1,"electric or hybrid@ * norway tops global sales of electric cars * electric, hybrid cars make up 52 pct of 2017 sales * big subsidies have aided shift from fossil fuel cars (adds bmw comment, details, background) oslo, jan 3 (reuters) - sales of electric and hybrid cars rose above half of new registrations in norway in 2017, a record aided by generous subsidies that extended the country's lead in shifting from fossil-fuel engines, data showed on wednesday. pure electric cars and hybrids, which have both battery power and a diesel or petrol motor, accounted for 52 percent of all new car sales last year in norway against 40 percent in 2016, the independent norwegian road federation (ofv) said. ""no one else is close"" in terms of a national share of electric cars, ofv chief oeyvind solberg thorsen said. ""for the first time we have a fossil-fuel market share below 50 percent."" norway exempts new electric cars from almost all taxes and grants perks that can be worth thousands of dollars a year in terms of free or subsidized parking, re-charging and use of toll roads, ferries and tunnels. it also generates almost all its electricity from hydropower, so the shift helps to reduce air pollution and climate change. last year, the international energy agency (iea) said norway was far ahead of other nations such as the netherlands, sweden, china, france and britain in electric car sales. by the iea yardstick, which excludes hybrid cars with only a small electric motor that cannot be plugged in, electric car sales in norway rose to 39 percent in 2017 from 29 in 2016, when the netherlands was in second on 6.4 percent. norwegian car sales in 2017 were topped by the volkswagen golf, bmwi3, toyota rav4 and tesla model x. the tesla is pure electric and others have electric or hybrid versions. in many countries, high prices of battery-driven cars, limited ranges between recharging and long charging times discourage buyers. car makers say the disadvantages are dwindling over time with new models. ""we view norway as a role model for how electric mobility can be promoted through smart incentives,"" a spokesman at bmws munich hq said. ""the situation would probably be different if these incentives were dropped."" other ""good examples"" of policies to spur electric-car demand include britain, california and the netherlands, he said. zero goal last year, norway's parliament set a non-binding goal that by 2025 all cars sold should be zero emissions. among other nations, france and britain plan to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040. christina bu, head of the norwegian electric vehicle association which represents owners, said the 2025 goal meant that norway should stick with its incentives for electric cars. ""it's an ambitious goal only seven years away,"" she told reuters. overall, sales of zero emissions cars in norway rose in 2017 to 21 percent from 16 in 2016. electric cars have widespread support among norway's 5.3 million people. a plan last year by the right-wing government to trim electric car incentives, dubbed a ""tesla tax,"" was dropped in negotiations on the 2018 budget. sales of diesel cars fell most in 2017, to 23 percent from 31 in 2016. some regions in norway have started to charge higher road tolls for diesel cars than for petrol-driven vehicles. norway's electric car policies are hard to imitate. norway can be generous because high revenues from oil and gas production have helped it amass the world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, worth $1 trillion. illustrating the supportive benefits, a volkswagen e-golf electric car sells for 262,000 crowns ($32,300) in norway, just fractionally above the import price of 260,000, according to the norwegian electric vehicle association. but a comparable gasoline-powered golf, which costs just 180,000 crowns to import, ends up selling for 298,000 crowns after charges including value added tax, carbon tax, and another tax based on the weight of the vehicle. even in norway, the benefits strain finances. norway's 1.3 trillion norwegian crown budget projects a loss of tax revenues of 3 billion crowns a year because of electric cars.

1,"brian snyder | reuters tesla motors ceo elon musk tesla shares rose on a narrower-than-expected loss on wednesday as the electric car maker made gains in model 3 production in april. while tesla continued to burn through cash at a much more rapid pace than the previous quarter to hit its production goals, burn rate was better than analysts had expected. but that doesn't put to rest the question of whether tesla will need more money in the near future. here's how the company did compared with what wall street expected: adjusted loss per share: -$3.35 per share vs. -$3.58 per share forecast by thomson reuters revenue: $3.41 billion vs. $3.22 billion forecast by thomson reuters in the quarter ended march 31, tesla's net loss widened to $784.6 million, or $4.19 per share, from a loss of $397.2 million, or $2.04 per share, a year ago. excluding items, tesla lost $3.35 per share, which was narrower than the loss of $3.58 per share a year ago. revenue rose to $3.41 billion from $2.7 billion a year ago, and outpaced analysts estimates of $3.22 billion. tesla ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. ""if we execute according to our plans, we will at least achieve positive net income excluding non-cash stock based compensation in q3 and q4 and we expect to also achieve full gaap profitability in each of these quarters,"" tesla said in a letter to shareholders. that assumes tesla can increase model 3 production volume to 5,000 units per week and grow model 3 gross margin ""to close to breakeven"" in the second quarter then to ""highly positive"" in the third and fourth quarters, the company said. ""ultimately, the growth of model 3 and the profit associated with it will help us accelerate the transition to sustainable energy even faster."" a change in tesla's accounting makes it impossible to directly compare tesla's year-over-year and quarterly numbers, including automotive revenue and gross margins. the company is now required to report lease transactions as sales, with all the revenue, income and costs for each lease recorded at once, rather than in monthly increments over the term of the lease. ""now they are basically listing more of their leases as direct auto sales, and if you look at the difference between the margins of the leases and the automotive sales, in 2017, lease margins were 36 percent and automotive sales margins were 21 percent,"" said vertical group analyst gordon johnson on cnbc's halftime report on wednesday. ""so we think there is going to be a hit on the automotive margin line."" in april, tesla revealed that it had missed its first-quarter production and delivery targets for the model 3, an electric sedan with a base price of $35,000. tesla produced 2,020 model 3s in the final week of the first quarter, short of its goal to produce 2,500 model 3 sedans weekly by the end of march. tesla aims to increase the model 3 production rate to 6,000 cars in a single week by the end of june, by running its fremont, california, factory around the clock , according to a leaked email that elon musk sent to employees . adding shifts, employees and paying more overtime have added costs for tesla at a time when it is also promising to produce new vehicles including a new roadster, model y and an all-electric semi truck. even so, musk said on twitter in mid-april that tesla would be both cash-flow positive and profitable in the second half of 2018. tesla has had only two profitable quarters since it went public in 2010. the company has also repeatedly missed deadlines and production targets."
1,"launceston, australia - (the opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for reuters.) it seems coal miners are adopting one of two disparate strategies, either exit the business in a highly visible way to buff up your climate credentials, or sit tight, keep as quiet as possible and rake in the cash. an example of the public exit from the business is south32, the perth-based miner spun out of bhp billiton which is in the process of selling out of its thermal coal assets in south africa. mike fraser, south32’s president and chief operating office for south africa, told reuters earlier this month that the company was aiming to sell its coal assets because it “did not believe in the commodity.” it would also be better if the coal mines were majority-owned by black investors, fraser said. this is a reasonable recognition that it’s increasingly hard for companies without black investors to do business in south africa, given its laws and rules aimed at promoting the economic interests of the majority population following centuries of discrimination under first colonial and then white-minority rule. south32 joins anglo american in getting out of south african coal, with the london-listed miner selling the last of its domestic coal assets to a majority black-owned company in january. anglo american will continue to export coal from south africa, but it will no longer be a participant in supplying the domestic market, which is dominated by the state power utility eskom. perhaps it’s not surprising that the two major coal asset sales this year are taking place in south africa, given the ongoing dispute between the government and the mining industry over a new mining charter and the requirements to increase the participation of black investors. but rio tinto also decided to exit its australian coal business, selling out to yancoal australia and glencore. if there is a trend at play here, it’s that diversified miners are the ones most likely to exit coal, and some have cited the risks of being in an increasingly unpopular business. activists and other investors are ramping up pressure on fund managers and sovereign wealth funds to divest from companies that are in coal. given coal was a tiny part of rio’s business, exiting the industry makes sense, especially if you can then tout yourself as a miner of metals that will be part of the electric vehicle and battery revolution. file photo: a signboard is seen outside bhp billiton's annual general meeting (agm) in melbourne, australia, november 16, 2017. aap/joe castro/via reuters risking ire the other choice is to stay in coal and try to mitigate any public backlash. bhp and its alliance partner mitsubishi are the world’s largest exporters of coking coal, used to make steel, and there are no signs that the miner intends to exit the business. same goes for glencore, and both these companies are probably calculating that the monetary rewards from coal still outweigh any public backlash. benjamin sporton, chief executive of industry group the world coal association, told reuters in an interview on monday that there was a positive mood among many coal miners. while sporton said coal producers acknowledge that the market is shrinking in europe and faces a huge challenge from cheap natural gas in the united states, asia is presenting good opportunities. “our membership see a strong future in asia,” he said, citing expectations that china and india will remain major importers of both thermal and coking coal, while demand will also be boosted by newer consumers in asia, such as vietnam and pakistan. the absence of major new coal mines and indonesia reducing exports to fuel domestic demand also means that supply to seaborne markets is likely to be constrained in coming years, even if there is a slowdown in the construction of new coal-fired generators. the reality for many existing coal miners is that conditions now are as good as they have been in living memory. the price of thermal coal is strong, with the asian thermal benchmark newcastle weekly index ending on feb. 23 at $110.60 a ton, the highest in six years. costs are also down, with the industry having cut every sliver of fat during the five years of declining prices from 2011 to 2015. an example of the strong conditions for coal miners is australia’s whitehaven coal, which on feb. 16 reported that its first-half underlying profit rose by about 63 percent to a$257.2 million ($204 million). it also paid a dividend for the first time since 2012. for coal miners who can take the heat of the public opinion kitchen these are good times. for those who no longer see coal as part of the future, they can sell out, at prices higher than what they might have expected a few years, and at the same time hopefully gain some climate-change credibility. editing by christian schmollinger"

0,"tesla inc shares fell as much as 2 percent in premarket trading on tuesday, a temporary halt in production of its model 3 sedan adding to nerves about the electric car maker’s consistent failure to keep its promises on vehicle output. model 3, the most affordable sedan from tesla, is seen as crucial to the company’s future profitability, but has so far missed several production goals. the car maker said the halt - the second since february - was to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks to increase production, a regular move by car companies. “while temporary suspensions to production, in order to improve manufacturing engineering/line rates, are not uncommon in the auto industry, particularly during a ramp-up, we believe that the news will once more be taken negatively by the market; providing more honey to the bears,” evercore isi analysts said. tesla’s use of robots to assemble model 3s had led to more complexity and delays, which billionaire chief executive elon musk acknowledged on friday in a tweet: “excessive automation at tesla was a mistake. to be precise, my mistake. humans are underrated.” according to bernstein analysts, tesla has not only automated stamping, painting and welding like most other manufacturers, but also tried to automate final assembly. this is where the u.s. electric car maker seems to be facing problems. “tesla’s been trying to run full tilt,” said chaim siegel, an analyst at elazar advisors. “he’s (musk is) sleeping overnight on the production floor. i don’t think there is any way they’d purposely want to slow production. it tells me something’s not quite right,” model 3 production fell short of the weekly target of 2,500 at the end of the first quarter and a number of wall street analysts say they do not believe it will succeed in producing 5,000 model 3s per week in the second quarter, as musk has promised. “i can’ t imagine that tesla can reach an output of 5,000 cars per week until the end of june,” said frank schwope, an analyst with nord/lb. “i expect that tesla is going to fail (in) their aims for this year, as they did so often.” shares of palo alto, california-based tesla was last down nearly 1 percent.

1,"tokyo (reuters) - toyota motor corp ( 7203.t ) has found a way to reduce the amount of a key rare earth metal used in magnets for electric car motors by around 20 percent, which could tame the cost of producing electric cars and reduce the risk of a supply shortage of materials needed for their production. the japanese automaker on tuesday said it had developed a magnet which replaces some of the neodymium, a rare earth metal used in the world’s most powerful permanent batteries, with more abundant and cheaper lanthanum and cerium, adding that it aimed to use the magnets in electric vehicle motors within the next 10 years. as production of hybrid and other electric cars is expected to ramp up in the coming years, automakers and electronics companies have been developing new high-powered magnets which require less rare earth metals to reduce costs and trim exposure to possible fluctuations in supply. a temporary export ban of neodymium by major supplier china in 2010 during a territorial dispute with japan and periodic supply shortages have highlighted automakers’ dependence on these materials. “an increase in electric car production will raise the need for motors, which will result in higher demand for neodymium down the line,” akira kato, general project manager at toyota’s advanced r&d and engineering company, told reporters at a briefing in tokyo. “if we continue to use neodymium at this pace we’ll eventually experience a supply shortage ... so we wanted to come up with technology which would help conserve neodymium stocks.” at the moment, magnets used in most automobiles to operate motors for everything from hybrid and other electric drivetrains to power steering systems comprise a total of around 30 percent of the rare earth elements neodymium, terbium and dysprosium. automakers including honda motor co ltd ( 7267.t ) have found ways to eliminate dysprosium and terbium, which cost around $400 and $900 per kilogram, respectively, from magnets by increasing the amount of neodymium, which costs around $100 per kilogram. toyota has come up with a way to cut out the expensive metals from the magnets and also reduce the amount of neodymium in favor of lanthanum and cerium, which each cost around $5-$7 per kilogram. kato declined to give specific details on cost reductions, but said that toyota could replace up to half of the neodymium used in magnets for motors which operate conventional vehicle functions like power windows with lanthanum and cerium, and around 20 percent for electric motor magnets. reporting by naomi tajitsuediting by christopher cushing"

0,"salt lake city (ap) — a utah driver turned on the semi-autonomous functions of her tesla vehicle and then didn't touch the steering wheel again for 80 seconds before slamming into a firetruck stopped at a red light last week, a summary of data from the car released wednesday showed. the national highway traffic safety administration has sent its special crash investigations team to the state, the agency said as details about the friday evening crash became public wednesday. according to south jordan police's summary of technician findings, the 28-year-old driver had repeatedly enabled and disabled the autopilot features of her tesla model s throughout the course of her drive. she took her hands off the wheel more than a dozen times, twice for more than a minute each. the driver re-enabled autopilot 1 minute and 22 seconds before the crash, let go of the wheel 2 seconds later and then didn't touch the wheel again before hitting the truck at 60 mph (97 kph). she had previously told police that she had engaged the system and was looking at her phone to compare route maps when the accident occurred. the driver, who suffered a broken foot in the accident, has not been identified. she was issued a traffic infraction for failing to keep proper lookout. the driver of the firetruck was checked for whiplash injuries but did not go to the hospital. in a statement wednesday, tesla said that drivers are repeatedly warned to keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicle at all times. ""tesla has always been clear that autopilot doesn't make the car impervious to all accidents,"" the statement said. south jordan police reiterated that drivers of semi-autonomous vehicles must remain alert and in control of the vehicle at all times. tesla's autopilot relies on a system of radar, cameras with 360-degree visibility and sensors to detect nearby objects and perform basic functions such as parking and steering. the features include emergency braking, which tesla advertises as being able to ""detect objects and automatically apply brakes to help avoid or lessen impact."" tesla says the system is not designed to avoid a collision and warns drivers not to rely on it entirely. it's unclear if that system activated before the utah crash. according to the summary released by police, the driver pressed on the brake herself ""fractions of a second prior to the crash"" and the vehicle had not slowed down from the speed she had set for cruise control. the utah accident is the latest incident involving an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle that has prompted scrutiny from federal regulators. the nhtsa and the national transportation safety board are investigating a march crash involving a tesla model x in california where the driver was killed. the autopilot system was engaged in that crash. also in march, an arizona pedestrian was killed by a self-driving uber car with a backup driver behind the wheel. the ntsb said it has not opened an investigation into the utah crash."

retailer plans to close another 200 stores and lay off a significant portion of its corporate staff following a disappointing holiday sales season, the wsj’s lillian rizzo and paul ziobro report, a signal of growing concern over the financial state of a business that has been reeling from the internet-fed upheaval in the toy industry . the latest wave of closings would cut nearly in half the number of u.s. stores it had before its bankruptcy filing. the company had poor holiday sales during a high-stakes period when toy retailers traditionally rake in a big share of their business. suppliers that have seen a major outlet deteriorate in the changed retail environment now will be weighing how much to feed into toys “r” us distribution channels while they consider whether to look for new pipelines to customers. regional grocers appear to be in retreat. northeast u.s. supermarket chain tops markets llc is entering chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the wsj’s katy stech ferek and heather haddon report, the latest move by a bread-and-butter food retail chain to reset its balance sheet in a shifting consumer market. tops has been hit by more than the move to online shopping. the business bought a food wholesaler and a logistics provider several years ago, and has been battling a teamsters union pension fund for more than four years over some $180 million the union says tops now owes. that’s just one problem at a business with $1.2 billion in debt and operations in an increasingly difficult market. the consumer drive to discount grocers, club chains and e-commerce sites helped push chains marsh supermarkets llc and central grocers inc. into bankruptcy last year, and southeast grocer bi-lo llc is in talks with bondholders about its debt. the push for raw materials in technology supply chains is turning into a race. apple inc. has reportedly been in talks to buy cobalt directly from miners to ensure it has enough of an ingredient central to components in its iphones and other electronics . the talks, reported by bloomberg, are the latest sign of the stresses that are developing in the tech world as a flood of smartphones and the new and growing production of electric vehicles triggers booming demand for cobalt—an essential ingredient in lithium-ion batteries. cobalt supplies are limited, and miners are looking for more sources ahead of what could be a big shortage—batteries for power electric cars require far more cobalt than the thin levels needed in smartphones. car companies are locking in their own supplies and apple, which usually leaves materials sourcing to its manufacturers, wants to ensure it has the minerals to match its ambitious production goals. commodities pure refined cobalt at a rotterdam warehouse. photo: herman van heusden for the wall street journal the latest sign of resurgence in the commodities sector is that miners are digging not only for metals but for deals. swiss commodity giant glencore plc is the latest operator in the business to trumpet a turnaround, reporting that it quadrupled its net earnings to $5.8 billion and slashed its net debt by nearly a third from the year before. rising commodity prices have helped drive glencore’s comeback and that of the larger mining industry , and the wsj’s scott patterson reports that glencore’s booming cash flows give the company more room for transactions after moves in coal, copper and zinc last year. the improving commodities picture is giving new life to the dry-bulk shipping business. analysts at alphabulk say ship orders in the sector are rising after the order book for bulk vessels reached its lowest level in 16 years by one measure at the end of 2017. proposed new rules for u.s. meatpackers suggest the companies can speed up their supply chains without compromising food safety. the u.s. department of agriculture is advancing changes in oversight in pork production by allowing meatpackers to slaughter hogs faster and play a bigger role in policing food safety on their own. the moves are aimed at freeing up government inspectors while making plants more efficient , the wsj’s benjamin parkin and patrick mcgroarty write, but are raising alarms among consumer advocates and labor groups that argue the new rules would compromise food safety and the safety of workers. the debate highlights the conflict in industrial operations between technology-driven moves to cut costs and attention to factory fundamentals. the usda and meat companies say the business has fallen behind food-science and slaughterhouse technology, and new inspection practices can provide both safety and speed. quotable ‘ i think many of us in the trade need to understand and make a decision about whether we can continue to hang on

0,"detroit (ap) — electric cars have a lot of perks: zero emissions, a quiet ride and instant acceleration. but can they save you money? probably not. electric car prices are falling, but they still cost more than equivalent gas models because of their expensive batteries. a $7,500 federal tax credit — which survived the recent tax overhaul — helps erase that gap, but not entirely. after that, the math gets more complicated. some states and utilities offer incentives for electric vehicle owners. plugging in an electric car is generally cheaper than filling up a gas-powered one, but that depends on the local price of gas and electricity. some people can charge their electric cars at work, but others need to add a charging station to their garage. for ronald montoya, a consumer advice editor with the car shopping site edmunds.com , the bottom line is price. with gas prices averaging $2.56 per gallon, it's hard to make up the price premium of an electric vehicle — which can easily top $10,000 — within a three-year lease period, he says. electric car drivers are more likely to lease than gas car buyers; for example, 57 percent of nissan leaf electric cars are leased, compared to 30 percent of cars overall, edmunds says. (edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by the associated press.) still, electrics have benefits, both tangible — like lower maintenance costs — and intangible. owners can drive them in high-occupancy vehicle lanes, for example, or simply feel good that they're causing less pollution. ""we are still a car culture, and some of our personal identity is tied up in our cars,"" said david friedman, director of cars for consumers union, the policy division of consumer reports. here's a comparison of the 2018 nissan leaf electric car and the 2018 honda civic, a comparably sized small car. cost: the honda civic four-door sedan with an automatic transmission starts at $19,640. that's $10,350 less than the starting price of the nissan leaf, which is $29,990. electric cars are eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit until an automaker has sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the u.s.; nissan has sold around 150,000 leafs, so buyers can still get that credit. some states also offer incentives for electric vehicles; california, for example, will mail a $2,500 rebate check to electric car buyers, while colorado offers a $5,000 tax credit. friedman and montoya say leasing is smart, since technology is changing so rapidly, but there is still a significant difference in monthly lease payments: $229 for the leaf or $169 for the civic for three years. fueling: electric cars are cheaper to fuel. it costs $600 per year to charge a leaf, according to the u.s. government, which assumes drivers travel 15,000 miles per year and pay the national average of 13 cents per kwh for electricity. by comparison, you'll spend $1,050 on gas to fill up the civic. those figures fluctuate depending on where you live; in honolulu, for example, electricity is double the national average but gas is also expensive — 79 cents higher per gallon than the national average. there are other costs to take into consideration as well. if you're a first-time electric car buyer and you can't charge at work or at a public charger, you'll likely want to install a 240-volt charging port in your garage. expect to pay $1,500 to $2,000 for a charging station as well as installation fees, montoya says. maintenance: because they don't have gas engines, electric cars don't require regular oil changes or engine filter replacements. brakes get less wear, too, since the electric motor steps in to help slow the vehicle down. but some maintenance is the same, such as tire rotation or adding wiper fluid. edmunds estimates owners will spend $3,543 over five years on maintenance and repairs for the leaf, and $447 more — or $3,990 — for the civic. but electrics do have one significant looming cost: battery replacement. the leaf has an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty on its battery, but if you keep the car past that time, you could be facing an expensive repair. nissan currently charges $5,499 for a replacement battery if you turn in your old battery; installation is a few hundred dollars extra. depreciation: this is a big disadvantage for electric car buyers, and one reason it's popular to lease them. the value of electric vehicles falls quickly once they're driven off the lot. aaa estimates electric vehicles lose $5,704 in value each year they're owned, compared to $2,114 for small cars like the civic. electric cars haven't yet proven their durability, and buyers of used electrics are worried about battery costs. used electric vehicle buyers also aren't eligible for federal and state tax incentives. but the depreciation has a bright side: it makes used electric cars much more affordable for those willing to buy them, friedman says."
1,"Wades large, long items could fit in there just like in the Volt it would be replacing.I also liked the plastic hooks in the frunk that could hold grocery bags or take out bags so that things don't roll around. A nice little touch!Overall the Model 3 could never replace the utility of a Bolt but could replace the Volt easily. In our recent move, 80% of our furniture and large boxes we moved in the Bolt. Maybe 15% we moved in the Volt. (small boxes, clothes, etc) And then we rented a truck for our mattress and 2 couches.I'm hoping the Model Y is out by the time my Bolt lease is up. By then I'll have lots of plug-in crossovers to cross-shop!LOL when they said they ""expect it soon"" I didn't think they meant ""tomorrow""!Awesome! Go check it out. And yes I love this color as well. I got the Midnight Grey Metallic Bolt, very similar color. It just looks classy to me. My wife prefers red or black. She has a black Volt. So she'll probably go with black since she'll see the extra cost for paint and be like: Aww hell naw.I got the same e-mail with the white Model 3. So it doesn't seem to relate to the actual model in the gallery.Click to expand...Great, maybe it will be the Midnight Silver on Display. It is an hour each way to that store for me, there is no hole in my schedule for that trip until next Thursday. This weekend will probably be packed anyway, I will get more time to spend with it on Thursday most likely."
0,marswould raise the price of their vehicles. I don't think GM would either since they have to sell enough ZEVs/PHEVs to meet the ZEV states requirements.The price is too low for the MODEL 3... at sub $27K... there's not a single car on the market that's full EV that comes in at that price point with the features the MODEL 3 has. Even HYUNDAI.. know for cheap cars... sells the KONA EV for over $43K with pleather... bringing it to $33K.. still what would be $6-7K more expensive than a Tesla Model 3 partial premium. Tesla would probably raise the MODEL 3 price atleast $5-6K to keep it on par with the KONA after tax incentives... would make the shareholders happy with the increased profit. Tesla Model 3 sales would be backlogged for a year. And the way they would increase the price of the MOdel 3 would be by losing the partial premium option and adding more features for the entry model.. inflating the price that way. Phasing out the partial premium option altogether.
0,"So, just a quick thought on the braking issue. It's an odd result, as it is much farther than the 119 feet that Motor Trend got and Tesla's official result.Elon, who I imagine had engineers all over this after the article went out, said on Twitter last night that it's an ABS calibration algorithm issue which they can fix with an over-the-air update.Personally, I'm skeptical of that claim (if he's right, that's great), but I'm happy to see it escalate so quickly and be addressed. If it turns out to be a physical issue (crappy pads, for instance), they will fix those for existing vehicles as well."

0,"february 13, 2018 / 3:17 pm / updated an hour ago exclusive: london metal exchange aims to ban metal sourced with child labour pratima desai , tom daly 6 min read london/beijing (reuters) - the london metal exchange could remove companies from its list of approved metal suppliers if they fall short of industry standards following an outcry about cobalt mined by children in africa, three sources said. the exchange will issue principles for responsible sourcing in coming months and producers will have to show their metal meets industry standards that conform with the new lme guidelines, the sources familiar with the matter said. “the lme has to be policeman. it can do that by making sure industry standards on child labour and conflict minerals are being met, that there is auditing and certification,” a source on an lme committee said. the responsible sourcing of metals such as cobalt has come into focus as manufacturers scramble to secure supplies of the key component in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries ahead of an expected surge in electric car sales. carmakers such as volkswagen have asked suppliers to ensure cobalt does not come from child labour and concern some of the metal in lme approved warehouses may be tainted has led some consumers to shun its contracts. while there is no single industry-wide standard for responsible mineral supply chains, the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) has a five-step framework and the cobalt institute is developing its own standards. to make progress on responsible sourcing, the lme sent a survey to producers in november asking about the sourcing, auditing and certification of metal that can be delivered against lme contracts. responses were due by dec. 1. most have now responded though stragglers will be given a new deadline, possibly the end of the third quarter, or risk being named and shamed, the sources said. they said the process of establishing the principles, the adoption of specific standards that have to be adhered to and time to allow producers to meet the requirements could take up to two years, or possibly longer. the spotlight in has also fallen in recent years on tin, another metal traded on the lme that is used in electronics and can come from conflict zones or artisanal mining areas in africa. comes to a head the lme declined to comment on the survey responses or whether approved metal brands could be removed from its lists. “the lme is committed to facilitating the implementation of recognised responsible sourcing standards for its listed producers and expects to issue further guidance on this topic over the coming months,” the exchange said in a statement. rights group amnesty international brought the issue to a head with a 2016 report detailing the use of child labour in artisanal cobalt mines in democratic republic of congo and in 2017 it said some major electronics and car companies were not doing enough to clean up their supply chains. in december, nanjing hanrui cobalt, the main provider of raw material to lme approved cobalt supplier yantai cash, said some of its cobalt came from artisanal mines in congo and it couldn’t rule out child labour may have been used. file photo: the offices where the london metal exchange is headquartered are seen in the city of london, britain, january 18, 2018 reuters/peter nicholls/file photo worries about metal from yantai cash first emerged last june and prompted some in the cobalt industry, including sources on the lme’s cobalt committee, to call for it to be suspended from the lme list. yantai’s inclusion in the lme approved list at that time created a discount for the price of lme cobalt against prices gathered by metal bulletin, a trade publication, sources said. yantai cash joined china’s responsible cobalt initiative (rci) in december, which was formed by the china chamber of commerce of metals, minerals & chemicals importers & exporters and also includes major end users of cobalt such as apple inc. and samsung sdi. liu xiaohan, manager of the international trade department at yantai cash, told reuters the company realised the importance of building a responsible cobalt supply chain and was taking active measures to address the challenges. besides joining the rci, yantai cash was developing a responsible purchasing policy, carrying out third-party audits, preparing annual progress reports and making necessary information disclosures, liu said. identify risks one source familiar with the matter said yantai’s metal, which is one of nine approved lme cobalt brands, could be banned if the company has not shown good progress by the end of the year in applying the principles the exchange plans to announce. yantai’s liu said any talk of a ban was irresponsible and not grounded in fact. the lme has not approved any specific industry standards on responsible sourcing as yet. the oecd’s framework was developed by both member and non-member countries as well as the united nations group of experts for democratic republic of congo. the oecd also said on its website that it has worked with china’s chamber of commerce for metals and the ministry of commerce to develop chinese due diligence guidelines. china’s responsible cobalt initiative is calling on companies in the cobalt supply chain to recognise the oecd and chinese guidelines and align their policies with them. “the lme won’t set standards, that will be done by bodies like the oecd and the cobalt institute, but they can try to make sure standards on the environment are met and human rights are protected,” one cobalt trader said. the cobalt institute is working on what it calls the cobalt industry risk assessment framework. “we expect to be able to roll it out later this year,” said david weight, president of the cobalt institute. “the idea is to identify the risks for members and their customers and provide a framework that gives guidance on how to respond to risks.” the international tin research institute last year published a code of conduct for its members and the international council on mining and metals also has guidelines on responsible sourcing. reporting by pratima desai and tom daly; editing by veronica brown and david clarke"

1,"David Green said: ↑I have heard about coasting rather then regen, but have not driven that way myself. I am not a hypermiler, I am a get there as fast as I can kind of driver. Back when I had my Volt I tried to stretch the miles, and usually stayed at the speed limits, but that car only had 40 miles of range, before you get to the Ice engine. I did not even know about the L setting until I had the car for 6 months. I used that, and in the summer often got over 45 to 50 miles on a charge.Regarding regen level in Bolt vs Model 3, there is an fundamental drivetrain difference in the two vehicles right now. Bolt is FWD; Model 3 is RWD.In an ICE this doesn’t matter, mechanical brakes do all the stopping with the front brakes shouldering the majority of the load. That is just how the physics work. You would quickly lock your rear wheels if you attempted to heavily brake with rear wheels only.The limit is likely based on tire grip with the current Model 3, not motor/battery current.
